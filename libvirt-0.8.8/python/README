    libvirt Python Bindings README
    ==============================

Most of the libvirt python binding code is automatically generated
using the script  generator.py, and the API description from
docs/libvirt-api.xml


Manually written files:

 - libvirt-override.c: methods where the C binding needs to be hand crafted
 - libvirt-override.py: global methods where the C and python bindings have different args
 - libvirt-override-api.xml: methods where the auto-extracted API docs are not
   suitable for python auto-generator. Overriding this if the method is going
   into libvirt-override.c, but we still want auto-generated libvirt-override.py
 - libvirt-override-virConnect.py: virConnect class methods
 - typewrappers.h,.c: Python object wrappers for each libvirt C object


Auto-generated files:

  - libvirt.py: The main python binding. Comprises auto-generated code, along
    with contents from libvirt-override.py and libvirt-override-virConnect.py
  - libvirt.c, libvirt.h: The C glue layer for the python binding. Comprises
    auto-generated code, along with libvirt-override.c
  - libvirt-export.c: List of auto-generated C methods, included into
    the libvirt-override.c method table
