Network options:
-net nic[,vlan=n][,macaddr=addr][,model=type]
                create a new Network Interface Card and connect it to VLAN 'n'
-net user[,vlan=n][,hostname=host]
                connect the user mode network stack to VLAN 'n' and send
                hostname 'host' to DHCP clients
-net tap[,vlan=n][,fd=h][,ifname=name][,script=file][,downscript=dfile]
                connect the host TAP network interface to VLAN 'n' and use the
                network scripts 'file' (default=/etc/qemu-ifup)
                and 'dfile' (default=/etc/qemu-ifdown);
                use '[down]script=no' to disable script execution;
                use 'fd=h' to connect to an already opened TAP interface
-net socket[,vlan=n][,fd=h][,listen=[host]:port][,connect=host:port]
                connect the vlan 'n' to another VLAN using a socket connection
-net socket[,vlan=n][,fd=h][,mcast=maddr:port]
                connect the vlan 'n' to multicast maddr and port
-net none       use it alone to have zero network devices; if no -net option
                is provided, the default is '-net nic -net user'

-tftp dir       allow tftp access to files in dir [-net user]
-bootp file     advertise file in BOOTP replies
-smb dir        allow SMB access to files in 'dir' [-net user]
-redir [tcp|udp]:host-port:[guest-host]:guest-port

Linux boot specific:
-kernel bzImage use 'bzImage' as kernel image
-append cmdline use 'cmdline' as kernel command line
-initrd file    use 'file' as initial ram disk

Debug/Expert options:
-monitor dev    redirect the monitor to char device 'dev'
-serial dev     redirect the serial port to char device 'dev'
-parallel dev   redirect the parallel port to char device 'dev'
-pidfile file   Write PID to 'file'
-S              freeze CPU at startup (use 'c' to start execution)
-s              wait gdb connection to port
-p port         set gdb connection port [default=1234]
-d item1,...    output log to /tmp/qemu.log (use -d ? for a list of log items)
-hdachs c,h,s[,t]  force hard disk 0 physical geometry and the optional BIOS
                translation (t=none or lba) (usually qemu can guess them)
-L path         set the directory for the BIOS, VGA BIOS and keymaps
-no-kvm         disable KVM hardware virtualization
-no-kvm-irqchip disable KVM kernel mode PIC/IOAPIC/LAPIC
-no-kvm-pit	    disable KVM kernel mode PIT
-std-vga        simulate a standard VGA card with VESA Bochs Extensions

-no-shutdown    stop before shutdown
-loadvm [tag|id]  start right away with a saved state (loadvm in monitor)
-vnc display    start a VNC server on display
-daemonize      daemonize QEMU after initializing
-tdf            inject timer interrupts that got lost
-kvm-shadow-memory megs set the amount of shadow pages to be allocated
-mem-path       set the path to hugetlbfs/tmpfs mounted directory, also enables allocation of guest memory with huge pages
-option-rom rom load a file, rom, into the option ROM space
-clock          force the use of the given methods for timer alarm.
                To see what timers are available use -clock ?
-startdate      select initial date of the clock
-icount [N|auto]
                Enable virtual instruction counter with 2^N clock ticks per instruction

During emulation, the following keys are useful:
ctrl-alt-f      toggle full screen
ctrl-alt-n      switch to virtual console 'n'
ctrl-alt        toggle mouse and keyboard grab

When using -nographic, press 'ctrl-a h' to get some help.
