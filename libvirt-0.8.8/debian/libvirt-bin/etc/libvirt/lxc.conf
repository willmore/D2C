# Master configuration file for the LXC driver.
# All settings described here are optional - if omitted, sensible
# defaults are used.

# By default, log messages generated by the lxc controller go to the
# container logfile. It is also possible to accumulate log messages
# from all lxc controllers along with libvirtd's log outputs. In this
# case, the lxc controller will honor either LIBVIRT_LOG_OUTPUTS or
# log_outputs from libvirtd.conf.
#
# This is disabled by default, uncomment below to enable it.
