        Archipel is a libvirt-based solution to manage and supervise virtual
        machines.  It uses XMPP for all communication. There is no web
        service or custom protocol.  You just need at least one XMPP server,
        like eJabberd, to start playing with it.  This allows Archipel to
        work completely real time.  You never have to refresh the user
        interface, you'll be notified as soon as something happens. You can
        even use your favorite chat clients to command your infrastructure.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        Isn't it great to be able to open a chat conversation with your
        virtual machine and say things like "How are you today?" or "Hey,
        please reboot"?

        This plugin for Jenkins adds a way to control guest domains hosted
        on Xen or QEMU/KVM.  You configure a Jenkins Slave,
        selecting the guest domain and hypervisor.  When you need to build a
        job on a specific Slave, its guest domain is started, then the job is
        run.  When the build process is finished, the guest domain is shut
        down, ready to be used again as required.

        An older tool for converting a physical machine into a virtual
        machine.  It is a LiveCD which is booted on the machine to be
        converted.  It collects a little information from the user, then
