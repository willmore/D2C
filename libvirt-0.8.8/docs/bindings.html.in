    <h1 >Bindings for other languages</h1>

    <p>
      Libvirt supports C and C++ directly, and has bindings available
      for other languages:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>C#</strong>: Arnaud Champion develops
        <a href="csharp.html">C# bindings</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Java</strong>: Daniel Veillard develops
        <a href="java.html">Java bindings</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>OCaml</strong>: Richard Jones develops
        <a href="http://libvirt.org/ocaml/">OCaml bindings</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Perl</strong>: Daniel Berrange develops
        <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Sys-Virt/">Perl bindings</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>PHP</strong>: Radek Hladik started developing
          <a href="http://libvirt.org/php">PHP bindings</a> in 2010.
        </p>
        <p>
          In February 2011 the binding development has been moved to the libvirt.org website as
          libvirt-php project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project is now maintained by Michal Novotny and it's heavily based
          on Radek's version. For more information, including
          information on posting patches to libvirt-php, please refer
          to the <a href="http://libvirt.org/php">PHP bindings</a> site.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Python</strong>: Libvirt comes with direct support for
          the Python language.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your libvirt is installed as packages, rather than compiled
          by you from source code, ensure you have the appropriate
          package installed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is named <b>libvirt-python</b> on RHEL/Fedora,
          <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=python-libvirt"><b>python-libvirt</b></a>
          on Ubuntu, and may be named differently on others.
