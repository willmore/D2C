	qemu: Error prompt when saving a shutoff domain
	"qemudDomainSaveFlag" goto wrong label "endjob", which will cause
	error when security manager trying to restore label (regression).

	As it's more reasonable to check if vm is shutoff immediately, and
	return right away if it is, remove the checking in "qemudDomainSaveFlag",
	and add checking in "qemudDomainSave".

	qemu: Fix command line generation with faked host CPU
	The code expected that host CPU architecture matches the architecture on
	which libvirt runs. This is normally true but not in tests, where host
	CPU is faked to produce consistent results.

	tests: Fake host capabilities properly
	Since we fake host CPU we should also fake host arch instead of taking
	the real architecture tests are running on.

	Avoid empty strings when --with-packager(-version) is not specified
	Make with_packager and with_packager_version default to "no". This way
	--without-packager-version (as shorthand for --with-packager(-version)=no)
	works correctly too.

	Prior to this patch libvirt outputs a line like this when
	--with-packager(-version) was not specified

	# ./daemon/libvirtd
	14:11:15.018: 31796: info : libvirt version: 0.8.8, package:  ()

	Now the unspecified parts are correctly omitted.

	build: address clang reports about virCommand
	clang had 5 reports against virCommand; three were false positives
	(a NULL deref in ProcessIO solved by sa_assert, and two uninitialized
	memory operations solved by adding an initializer), but two were real.

	* src/util/command.c (virCommandProcessIO): Fix real bug of
	possible NULL dereference.  Teach clang that buf is never NULL.
	(virCommandRun): Teach clang that infd is only ever accessed when
	initialized.

	build: silence some clang warnings
	* tools/virsh.c (cmdHelp): Kill dead variables.

	qemu: don't mask real error with oom report
	* src/qemu/qemu_command.c (qemuBuildCommandLine): Don't report oom
	after qemuBuildControllerDevStr, which reported its own errors.

	qemu: avoid NULL derefs
	The processWatchdogEvent fix is real, although it can only trigger
	on OOM, since bad things happen if doCoreDump is called with a NULL
	pathname argument.  The other fixes silence clang, but aren't a real
	bug because virReportErrorHelper tolerates a NULL format string even
	though *printf does not.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (processWatchdogEvent): Exit on OOM.
	(qemuDomainIsActive, qemuDomainIsPersistent, qemuDomainIsUpdated):
	Provide valid message.

	virDomainMemoryStats: avoid null dereference
	* src/libvirt.c (virDomainMemoryStats): Check domain before flags.

	add missing error handling to virGetDomain
	When creating the virDomain::snapshots hash table, virGetDomain
	wasn't checking if the creation was successful. This would then
	lead to failures in the vir*DomainSnapshot functions. Better to
	report this error early and make virGetDomain fail if the
	snapshots hash couldn't be created.
	* src/datatypes.c: report failure to make a hash table

	call virReportOOMError when appropriate in hash.c
	A couple of allocation were not calling virReportOOMError on allocation
	errors

	* src/util/hash.c: add the needed call in virHashCreate and
	  virHashAddOrUpdateEntry

	storage: Create enough volumes for mpath pool
	"virStorageBackendCreateVols":
	  "names->next" serves as condition expression for "do...while",
	however, "names" was shifted before, it then results in one less
	loop, and thus, one less volume will be created for mpath pool,
	the patch is to fix it.

	qemu: avoid NULL deref on error
	* src/qemu/qemu_command.c (qemuParseCommandLineDisk): Report error
	before cleaning def.

	build: silence false positive clang report
	clang complained that STREQ(group->controllers[i].mountPoint,...)  was
	a NULL dereference when i==VIR_CGROUP_CONTROLLER_CPUSET, because it
	assumes the worst about virCgroupPathOfController.  Marking the
	argument const doesn't yet have an effect, per this clang bug:
	http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=7758

	So, we use sa_assert, which was designed to shut up false positives
	from tools like clang.

	* src/util/cgroup.c (virCgroupMakeGroup): Teach clang that there
	is no NULL dereference.

	qemu: ignore failure of qemu -M ? on older qemu

	Fix cleanup on VM state after failed QEMU startup
	Commit 9962e406c664ed5521f5aca500c860a331cb3979 introduced a
	problem where if the VM failed to startup, it would not be
	correctly cleaned up. Amongst other things the SELinux
	security label would not be removed, which prevents the VM
	from ever starting again.

	The virDomainIsActive() check at the start of qemudShutdownVMDaemon
	checks for vm->def->id not being -1. By moving the assignment of the
	VM id to the start of qemudStartVMDaemon, we can ensure cleanup will
	occur on failure

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Move initialization of 'vm->def->id'
	  so that qemudShutdownVMDaemon() will process the shutdown

	* tools/virsh.c (vshPrint): Change redirect.
	(vshPrintExtra): Allow use within vshPrint.  Avoid fprintf on

	xen: Prevent updating device when attaching a device
	When attaching a device that already exists, xend driver updates
	the device with "device_configure", it causes problems (e.g. for
	disk device, 'device_configure' only can be used to update device
	like CDROM), on the other hand, we provide additional API
	(virDomainUpdateDevice) to update device, this fix is to raise up
	errors instead of updating the existed device which is not CDROM
	device.

	Changes from v1 to v2:
	  - allow to update CDROM

	build: fix cygwin strerror_r failure
	Building the 0.8.8 release candidate on cygwin produced this compiler

	  CC       strerror_r.lo
	strerror_r.c: In function 'rpl_strerror_r':
	strerror_r.c:67: warning: assignment makes integer from pointer without a cast

	This has been fixed in gnulib.

	* .gnulib: Update to latest, for strerror_r fix.
	* src/util/memory.c (includes): Satisfy 'make syntax-check'.

	qemu: Fix escape_monitor(escape_shell(command))
	Suspending a VM which contains shell meta characters doesn't work with
	libvirt-0.8.7:
	/var/log/libvirt/qemu/andreas_231-ne\ doch\ nicht.log:
	  sh: -c: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `doch'
	  sh: -c: line 0: `cat | { dd bs=4096 seek=1 if=/dev/null && dd bs=1048576; }

	Although target="andreas_231-ne doch nicht" contains shell meta
	characters (here: blanks), they are not properly escaped by
	src/qemu/qemu_monitor_{json,text}.c#qemuMonitor{JSON,Text}MigrateToFile()

	First, the filename needs to be properly escaped for the shell, than
	this command line has to be properly escaped for qemu again.

	For this to work, remove the old qemuMonitorEscapeArg() wrapper, rename
	qemuMonitorEscape() to it removing the handling for shell=TRUE, and
	implement a new qemuMonitorEscapeShell() returning strings using single
	quotes.

	Using double quotes or escaping special shell characters with backslashes
	would also be possible, but the set of special characters heavily
	depends on the concrete shell (dsh, bash, zsh) and its setting (history
	expansion, interactive use, ...)

	Imprint all logs with version + package build information
	The logging functions are enhanced so that immediately prior to
	the first log message being printed to any output channel, the
	libvirt package version will be printed.

	eg

	 $ LIBVIRT_DEBUG=1 virsh
	 18:13:28.013: 17536: info : libvirt version: 0.8.7
	 18:13:28.013: 17536: debug : virInitialize:361 : register drivers
	 ...

	The 'configure' script gains two new arguments which can be
	used as

	   --with-packager="Fedora Project, x86-01.phx2.fedoraproject.org, 01-27-2011-18:00:10"
	   --with-packager-version="1.fc14"

	to allow distros to append a custom string with package specific
	data.

	The RPM specfile is modified so that it appends the RPM version,
	the build host, the build date and the packager name.

	eg

	 $ LIBVIRT_DEBUG=1 virsh
	 18:14:52.086: 17551: info : libvirt version: 0.8.7, package: 1.fc13 (Fedora Project, x86-01.phx2.fedoraproject.org, 01-27-2011-18:00:10)
	 18:14:52.086: 17551: debug : virInitialize:361 : register drivers

	Thus when distro packagers receive bug reports they can clearly
	see what version was in use, even if the bug reporter mistakenly
	or intentionally lies about version/builds

	* src/util/logging.c: Output version data prior to first log message
	* libvirt.spec.in: Include RPM release, date, hostname & packager
	* configure.ac: Add --with-packager & --with-packager-version args

	qemu: fix attach-interface regression
	QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_PCI_MULTIBUS should be set in the function
	qemuCapsExtractVersionInfo()

	The flag QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_PCI_MULTIBUS is used in the function
	qemuBuildDeviceAddressStr(). All callers get qemuCmdFlags
	by the function qemuCapsExtractVersionInfo() except that
	testCompareXMLToArgvFiles() in qemuxml2argvtest.c.

	So we should set QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_PCI_MULTIBUS in the function
	qemuCapsExtractVersionInfo() instead of qemuBuildCommandLine()
	because the function qemuBuildCommandLine() does not be called
	when we attach a pci device.

	tests: set QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_PCI_MULTIBUS in testCompareXMLToArgvFiles()

	set QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_PCI_MULTIBUS before calling qemuBuildCommandLine()
	as the flags is not set by qemuCapsExtractVersionInfo().

	Avoid pthread_sigmask on Win32 platforms
	Win32 doesn't have a concept of signal masks so disable that
	code. It is unclear how SIGINT is delivered (if at all) on
	Win32, so this might further work to provide an alternative
	to pthread_sigmask

	* tools/virsh.c: Avoid pthread_sigmask on Win32

	Reduce log level when cgroups aren't mounted
	Quite a few hosts don't have cgroups mounted and so see warnings
	from libvirt logged, which then cause bug reports, etc. Reduce
	the log level to INFO so they're not visible by default

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Reduce log level for cgroups

	Avoid warnings from nwfilter driver when run non-root
	When run non-root the nwfilter driver logs error messages about
	being unable to find iptables/ebtables commands (they are in
	/sbin which isn't in $PATH). The nwfilter driver can't ever work
	as non-root, so simply skip it entirely thus avoiding the error
	messages

	* src/conf/nwfilter_conf.h, src/nwfilter/nwfilter_driver.c,
	  src/nwfilter/nwfilter_gentech_driver.c,
	  src/nwfilter/nwfilter_gentech_driver.h: Pass 'bool privileged'

	Don't use CLONE_NEWUSER for now
	Until now, user namespaces have not done much, but (for that
	reason) have been innocuous to glob in with other CLONE_
	flags.  Upcoming userns development, however, will make tasks
	cloned with CLONE_NEWUSER far more restricted.  In particular,
	for some time they will be unable to access files with anything
	other than the world access perms.

	This patch assumes that noone really needs the user namespaces
	to be enabled.  If that is wrong, then we can try a more
	baroque patch where we create a file owned by a test userid with
	700 perms and, if we can't access it after setuid'ing to that
	userid, then return 0.  Otherwise, assume we are using an
	older, 'harmless' user namespace implementation.

	Comments appreciated.  Is it ok to do this?

	spicevmc: support older -device spicevmc of qemu 0.13.0
	qemu 0.13.0 (at least as built for Fedora 14, and also backported to
	RHEL 6.0 qemu) supported an older syntax for a spicevmc channel; it's
	not as flexible (it has an implicit name and hides the chardev

	qemu: Support booting from hostdev PCI devices

	Support booting from hostdev devices

	qemu: Add shortcut for HMP pass through
	Currently users who want to use virDomainQemuMonitorCommand() API or
	it's virsh equivalent has to use the same protocol as libvirt uses for
	communication to qemu. Since the protocol is QMP with current qemu and
	HMP much more usable for humans, one ends up typing something like the
	following:

	    virsh qemu-monitor-command DOM \
	'{"execute":"human-monitor-command","arguments":{"command-line":"info kvm"}}'

	which is not a very convenient way of debugging qemu.

	This patch introduces --hmp option to qemu-monitor-command, which says
	that the provided command is in HMP. If libvirt uses QMP to talk with
	qemu, the command will automatically be converted into QMP. So the
	example above is simplified to just

	    virsh qemu-monitor-command --hmp DOM "info kvm"

	Also the result is converted from

	    {"return":"kvm support: enabled\r\n"}

	to just plain HMP:

	    kvm support: enabled

	If libvirt talks to qemu in HMP, --hmp flag is obviously a noop.

	qemu: avoid double shutdown
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemudShutdownVMDaemon): Check that vm is
	still active.
	Reported by Wen Congyang as follows:

	Steps to reproduce this bug:

	1. use gdb to debug libvirtd, and set breakpoint in the function
	   qemuConnectMonitor()
	2. start a vm, and the libvirtd will be stopped in qemuConnectMonitor()
	3. kill -STOP $(cat /var/run/libvirt/qemu/<domain>.pid)
	4. continue to run libvirtd in gdb, and libvirtd will be blocked in the
	   function qemuMonitorSetCapabilities()
	5. kill -9 $(cat /var/run/libvirt/qemu/<domain>.pid)

	Here is log of the qemu:
	=========
	LC_ALL=C PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin ...
	char device redirected to /dev/pts/3
	2011-01-27 09:38:48.101: shutting down
	2011-01-27 09:41:26.401: shutting down
	=========

	The vm is shut down twice. I do not know whether this behavior has
	side effect, but I think we should shutdown the vm only once.

	Don't sleep in poll() if there is existing SASL decoded data
	In the SASL codepath we typically read far more data off the
	wire than we immediately need. When using a connection from a
	single thread this isn't a problem, since only our reply will
	be pending (or an event we can handle directly). When using a
	connection from multiple threads though, we may read the data
	from replies from other threads. If those replies occur after
	our own reply, they'll not be processed. The other thread will
	then go into poll() and wait for its reply which has already
	been received and decoded. The solution is to set poll() timeout
	to 0 if there is pending SASL data.

	esx: Ensure max-memory has 4 megabyte granularity

	Add VIR_DIV_UP to divide memory or storage request sizes with round up
	Use it in all places where a memory or storage request size is converted
	to a larger granularity. This avoids requesting too small memory or storage
	sizes that could result from the truncation done by a simple division.

	This extends the round up fix in 6002e0406c338668ea0ecbfeb6c1ef20a8b67efe
	to the whole codebase.

	Instead of reporting errors for odd values in the VMX code round them up.

	Update the QEMU Argv tests accordingly as the original memory size 219200
	isn't a even multiple of 1024 and is rounded up to 215 megabyte now. Change
	it to 219100 and 219136. Use two different values intentionally to make

	Force guest suspend at timeout
	If the memory of guest OS is changed constantly, the live migration
	can not be ended ever for ever.

	We can use the command 'virsh migrate-setmaxdowntime' to control the
	live migration. But the value of maxdowntime is diffcult to calculate
	because it depends on the transfer speed of network and constantly
	changing memroy size. We need a easy way to control the live migration.

	This patch adds the support of forcing guest to suspend at timeout.
	With this patch, when we migrate the guest OS, we can specify a
	timeout. If the live migration timeouts, auto-suspend the guest OS,
	where the migration will complete offline.

	in background that user isn't even aware of. It's not reasonable.

	This patch changes the behaviour for migration. For other
	commands Ctrl-C still terminates virsh itself.

	avoid vm to be deleted if qemuConnectMonitor failed
	Steps to reproduce this bug:
	1. service libvirtd start
	2. virsh start <domain>
	3. kill -STOP $(cat /var/run/libvirt/qemu/<domain>.pid)
	4. service libvirtd restart
	5. kill -9 $(cat /var/run/libvirt/qemu/<domain>.pid)

	Then libvirtd will core dump or be in deadlock state.

	Make sure that json is built into libvirt and the version
	of qemu is newer than 0.13.0.

	The reason of libvirtd cores dump is that:
	We add vm->refs when we alloc the memory, and decrease it
	in the function qemuHandleMonitorEOF() in other thread.

	We add vm->refs in the function qemuConnectMonitor() and
	decrease it when the vm is inactive.

	The libvirtd will block in the function qemuMonitorSetCapabilities()
	because the vm is stopped by signal SIGSTOP. Now the vm->refs is 2.

	Then we kill the vm by signal SIGKILL. The function
	qemuMonitorSetCapabilities() failed, and then we will decrease vm->refs
	in the function qemuMonitorClose().
	In another thread, mon->fd is broken and the function
	qemuHandleMonitorEOF() is called.

	If qemuHandleMonitorEOF() decreases vm->refs before qemuConnectMonitor()
	returns, vm->refs will be decrease to 0 and the memory is freed.

	We will call qemudShutdownVMDaemon() as qemuConnectMonitor() failed.
	The memory has been freed, so qemudShutdownVMDaemon() is too dangerous.

	We will reference NULL pointer in the function virDomainConfVMNWFilterTeardown():
	=============
	void
	virDomainConfVMNWFilterTeardown(virDomainObjPtr vm) {
	    int i;

	    if (nwfilterDriver != NULL) {
	        for (i = 0; i < vm->def->nnets; i++)
	            virDomainConfNWFilterTeardown(vm->def->nets[i]);
	    }
	}
	============
	vm->def->nnets is not 0 but vm->def->nets is NULL(We don't set vm->def->nnets
	to 0 when we free vm).

	We should add an extra reference of vm to avoid vm to be deleted if
	qemuConnectMonitor() failed.

	event: fix event-handling allocation crash
	Regression introduced in commit e6b68d7 (Nov 2010).

	Prior to that point, handlesAlloc was always a multiple of
	EVENT_ALLOC_EXTENT (10), and was an int (so even if the subtraction
	had been able to wrap, a negative value would be less than the count
	not try to free the handles array).  But after that point,
	VIR_RESIZE_N made handlesAlloc grow geometrically (with a pattern of
	10, 20, 30, 45 for the handles array) but still freed in multiples of
	EVENT_ALLOC_EXTENT; and the count changed to size_t.  Which means that
	after 31 handles have been created, then 30 handles destroyed,
	handlesAlloc is 5 while handlesCount is 1, and since (size_t)(1 - 5)
	is indeed greater than 1, this then tried to free 10 elements, which
	had the awful effect of nuking the handles array while there were
	still live handles.

	Nuking live handles puts libvirtd in an inconsistent state, and was
	easily reproducible by starting and then stopping 60 faqemu guests.

	* daemon/event.c (virEventCleanupTimeouts, virEventCleanupHandles):
	Avoid integer wrap-around causing us to delete the entire array
	while entries are still active.
	* tests/eventtest.c (mymain): Expose the bug.

	Manually kill gzip if restore fails before starting qemu
	If a guest image is saved in compressed format, and the restore fails
	in some way after the intermediate process used to uncompress the
	image has been started, but before qemu has been started to hook up to
	the uncompressor, libvirt will endlessly wait for the uncompressor to
	finish, but it never will because it's still waiting to have something
	hooked up to drain its output.

	The solution is to close the pipes on both sides of the uncompressor,
	then send a SIGTERM before calling waitpid on it (only if the restore
	has failed, of course).

	Set SELinux context label of pipes used for qemu migration
	This patch is a partial resolution to the following bug:

	   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=667756

	(to complete the fix, an updated selinux-policy package is required,
	to add the policy that allows libvirt to set the context of a fifo,
	which was previously not allowed).

	Explanation : When an incoming migration is over a pipe (for example,
	if the image was compressed and is being fed through gzip, or was on a
	root-squash nfs server, so needed to be opened by a child process
	running as a different uid), qemu cannot read it unless the selinux
	context label for the pipe has been set properly.

	The solution is to check the fd used as the source of the migration
	just before passing it to qemu; if it's a fifo (implying that it's a
	pipe), we call the newly added virSecurityManagerSetFDLabel() function
	to set the context properly.

	Add a function to the security driver API that sets the label of an open fd.
	A need was found to set the SELinux context label on an open fd (a
	pipe, as a matter of fact). This patch adds a function to the security
	driver API that will set the label on an open fd to secdef.label. For
	all drivers other than the SELinux driver, it's a NOP. For the SElinux
	driver, it calls fsetfilecon().

	If the return is a failure, it only returns error up to the caller if
	1) the desired label is different from the existing label, 2) the
	destination fd is of a type that supports setting the selinux context,
	and 3) selinux is in enforcing mode. Otherwise it will return
	success. This follows the pattern of the existing function
	SELinuxSetFilecon().

	qemu: sound: Support intel 'ich6' model
	In QEMU, the card itself is a PCI device, but it requires a codec
	(either -device hda-output or -device hda-duplex) to actually output
	sound. Specifying <sound model='ich6'/> gives us -device intel-hda
	-device hda-duplex I think it's important that a simple <sound model='ich6'/>
	sets up a useful codec, to have consistent behavior with all other sound cards.

	This is basically Dan's proposal of

	    <sound model='ich6'>
	        <codec type='output' slot='0'/>
	        <codec type='duplex' slot='3'/>
	    </sound>

	without the codec bits implemented.

	The important thing is to keep a consistent API here, we don't want some
	<sound> devs require tweaking codecs but not others. Steps I see to
	accomplishing this:

	    - every <sound> device has a <codec type='default'/> (unless codecs are
	        manually specified)
	    - <codec type='none'/> is required to specify 'no codecs'
	    - new audio settings like mic=on|off could then be exposed in
	        <sound> or <codec> in a consistent manner for all sound models

	v2:
	    Use model='ich6'

	v3:
	    Use feature detection, from eblake
	    Set codec id, bus, and cad values

	v4:
	    intel-hda isn't supported if -device isn't available

2011-01-22  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	event: fix event-handling data race
	This bug has been present since before the time that commit
	f8a519 (Dec 2008) tried to make the dispatch loop re-entrant.

	Dereferencing eventLoop.handles outside the lock risks crashing, since
	any other thread could have reallocated the array in the meantime.
	It's a narrow race window, however, and one that would have most
	likely resulted in passing bogus data to the callback rather than
	actually causing a segv, which is probably why it has gone undetected
	this long.

	qemu: Add conf option to auto setup VNC unix sockets
	If vnc_auto_unix_socket is enabled, any VNC devices without a hardcoded
	listen or socket value will be setup to serve over a unix socket in
	/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/$vmname.vnc.

	We store the generated socket path in the transient VM definition at
	CLI build time.

	qemu: Allow serving VNC over a unix domain socket
	QEMU supports serving VNC over a unix domain socket rather than traditional
	TCP host/port. This is specified with:

	<graphics type='vnc' socket='/foo/bar/baz'/>

	This provides better security access control than VNC listening on
	127.0.0.1, but will cause issues with tools that rely on the lax security
	(virt-manager in fedora runs as regular user by default, and wouldn't be
	able to access a socket owned by 'qemu' or 'root').

	Also not currently supported by any clients, though I have patches for
	virt-manager, and virt-viewer should be simple to update.

	tests: Add tests for per-device boot elements

	qemu: Support per-device boot ordering
	Support for this is included in qemu and seabios from upstream git.

	Introduce per-device boot element
	Currently, boot order can be specified per device class but there is no
	way to specify exact disk/NIC device to boot from.

	This patch adds <boot order='N'/> element which can be used inside
	<disk/> and <interface/>. This is incompatible with the older os/boot
	element. Since not all hypervisors support per-device boot
	specification, new deviceboot flag is included in capabilities XML for
	hypervisors which understand the new boot element. Presence of the flag
	allows (but doesn't require) users to use the new style boot order
	specification.

	tests: Remove obsolete secaatest
	Before the security driver was refactored in d6623003 seclabeltest and
	secaatest were basically the same. seclabeltest was meant for SELinux
	and secaatest for AppArmor. Both tests exited early when the specific
	security driver backend wasn't enabled.

	With the new security manager trying to initialize a disabled security
	driver backend is an error that can't be distinguished from other errors
	anymore. Therefore, the updated seclabeltest just asks for the first
	available backend as this will always work even with SELinux and AppArmor
	backend being disabled due to the new Nop backend.

	Remove the obsolete secaatest and compile and run the seclabeltest
	unconditional.

	This fixes make check on systems that support AppArmor.

	Enable tuning of qemu network tap device "sndbuf" size
	This is in response to a request in:

	   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=665293

	In short, under heavy load, it's possible for qemu's networking to
	lock up due to the tap device's default 1MB sndbuf being
	inadequate. adding "sndbuf=0" to the qemu commandline -netdevice
	option will alleviate this problem (sndbuf=0 actually sets it to
	0xffffffff).

	Because we must be able to explicitly specify "0" as a value, the
	standard practice of "0 means not specified" won't work here. Instead,
	virDomainNetDef also has a sndbuf_specified, which defaults to 0, but
	is set to 1 if some value was given.

	The sndbuf value is put inside a <tune> element of each <interface> in
	the domain. The intent is that further tunable settings will also be
	placed inside this element.

	     <interface type='network'>
	       ...
	       <tune>
	         <sndbuf>0</sndbuf>
	       ...
	       </tune>
	     </interface>

	Add XML config switch to enable/disable vhost-net support
	This patch is in response to

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=643050

	The existing libvirt support for the vhost-net backend to the virtio
	network driver happens automatically - if the vhost-net device is
	available, it is always enabled, otherwise the standard userland
	virtio backend is used.

	This patch makes it possible to force whether or not vhost-net is used
	with a bit of XML. Adding a <driver> element to the interface XML, eg:

	     <interface type="network">
	       <model type="virtio"/>
	       <driver name="vhost"/>

	will force use of vhost-net (if it's not available, the domain will
	fail to start). if driver name="qemu", vhost-net will not be used even
	if it is available.

	If there is no <driver name='xxx'/> in the config, libvirt will revert
	to the pre-existing automatic behavior - use vhost-net if it's
	available, and userland backend if vhost-net isn't available.

	Use the new set_password monitor command to set password.
	We try to use that command first when setting a VNC/SPICE password. If
	that doesn't work we fallback to the legacy VNC only password

	Allow an expiry time to be set, if that doesn't work, throw an error
	if they try to use SPICE.

	Change since v1:
	- moved qemuInitGraphicsPasswords to qemu_hotplug, renamed
	  to qemuDomainChangeGraphicsPasswords.
	- updated what looks like a typo (that appears to work anyway) in

	    -                                 driver->vncPassword);

	qemu: Watchdog IB700 is not a PCI device (RHBZ#667091).
	Skip IB700 when assigning PCI slots.

	Note: the I6300ESB watchdog _is_ a PCI device.

	To test this: I applied this patch to libvirt-0.8.3-2.fc14 (rebasing
	it slightly: qemu_command.c didn't exist in that version) and
	installed this on my machine, then tested that I could successfully
	add an ib700 watchdog device to a guest, start the guest, and the
	ib700 was available to the guest.  I also added an i6300esb (PCI)
	watchdog to another guest, and verified that libvirt assigned a PCI
	device to it, that the guest could be started, and that i6300esb was
	present in the guest.

	Note that if you previously had a domain with a ib700 watchdog, it
	would have had an <address type='pci' .../> clause added to it in the
	libvirt configuration.  This patch does not attempt to remove this.
	You cannot start such a domain -- qemu gives an error if you try.
	With this patch you are able to remove the bogus address element
	without libvirt adding it back.

	remote: Don't lose track of events when callbacks are slow
	After the remote driver runs an event callback, it unconditionally disables the
	loop timer, thinking it just flushed every queued event. This doesn't work
	correctly though if an event is queued while a callback is running.

	The events actually aren't being lost, it's just that the event loop didn't
	think there was anything that needed to be dispatched. So all those 'lost
	events' should actually get re-triggered if you manually kick the loop by
	generating a new event (like creating a new guest).

	The solution is to disable the dispatch timer _before_ we invoke any event
	callbacks. Events queued while a callback is running will properly reenable the
	timer.

	Refactor the security drivers to simplify usage
	The current security driver usage requires horrible code like

	    if (driver->securityDriver &&
	        driver->securityDriver->domainSetSecurityHostdevLabel &&
	        driver->securityDriver->domainSetSecurityHostdevLabel(driver->securityDriver,
	                                                              vm, hostdev) < 0)

	This pair of checks for NULL clutters up the code, making the driver
	calls 2 lines longer than they really need to be. The goal of the
	patchset is to change the calling convention to simply

	  if (virSecurityManagerSetHostdevLabel(driver->securityDriver,
	                                        vm, hostdev) < 0)

	The first check for 'driver->securityDriver' being NULL is removed
	by introducing a 'no op' security driver that will always be present
	if no real driver is enabled. This guarentees driver->securityDriver
	!= NULL.

	The second check for 'driver->securityDriver->domainSetSecurityHostdevLabel'
	being non-NULL is hidden in a new abstraction called virSecurityManager.
	This separates the driver callbacks, from main internal API. The addition
	of a virSecurityManager object, that is separate from the virSecurityDriver
	struct also allows for security drivers to carry state / configuration
	information directly. Thus the DAC/Stack drivers from src/qemu which
	used to pull config from 'struct qemud_driver' can now be moved into
	the 'src/security' directory and store their config directly.

	daemon: Fix core dumps if unix_sock_group is set
	Setting unix_sock_group to something else than default "root" in
	/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf prevents system libvirtd from dumping core on
	crash. This is because we used setgid(unix_sock_group) before binding to
	/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock* and setgid() back to original group.
	However, if a process changes its effective or filesystem group ID, it
	will be forbidden from leaving core dumps unless fs.suid_dumpable sysctl
	is set to something else then 0 (and it is 0 by default).

	Changing socket's group ownership after bind works better. And we can do
	so without introducing a race condition since we loosen access rights by
	changing the group from root to something else.

	Log an error on attempts to add a NAT rule for non-IPv4 addresses
	Although the upper-layer code protected against it, it was possible to
	call iptablesForwardMasquerade() with an IPv6 address and have it
	attempt to add a rule to the MASQUERADE chain of ip6tables (which
	doesn't exist).

	This patch changes that function to check the protocol of the given
	address, generate an error log if it's not IPv4 (AF_INET), and finally
	hardcodes all the family parameters sent down to lower-level functions.

	Improve error reporting when parsing dhcp info for virtual networks
	This is partially in response to

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=653300

	The crash in that report was coincidentally fixed when we switched
	from using inet_pton() to using virSocketParseAddr(), but the absence
	of an ip address in a dhcp static host definition was still silently
	ignored (and that entry discarded from the saved XML). This patch
	turns that into a logged failure; likewise if the entry has neither a
	mac address nor a name attribute (the entry is useless without at
	least one of those, plus an ip address).

	Since the network name is now pulled into this function in order for
	those error logs to be more informative, the other error messages in
	the function have also been changed to take advantage.

	qemu driver: fix positioning to end of log file

	To reproduce this error, you could do the following:

	dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/log/libvirt/qemu/<name of VM>.log bs=1024 count=$((1024*2048))

	and you should get an error like this:

	Improve virSocketAddrMask[ByPrefix] API
	The original version of these functions would modify the address sent
	in, meaning that the caller would usually need to copy the address
	first. This change makes the original a const, and puts the resulting
	masked address into a new arg (which could point to the same
	virSocketAddr as the original, if the caller really wants to modify
	it).

	This also makes the API consistent with virSocketAddrBroadcast[ByPrefix].

	Set broadcast address for IPv4 addresses on virtual network bridges
	Previously we used ioctl() to set the IP address and netmask of the
	bridges used for virtual networks, and apparently the SIOCSIFNETMASK
	ioctl implicitly set the broadcast address for the interface. The new
	method of using the "ip" command requires broadcast address to be
	explicitly specified though.

	Utility functions to produce an IPv4 broadcast address
	These functions work only for IPv4, becasue IPv6 doesn't have the same
	concept of "broadcast address" as IPv4. They merely OR the inverse of
	the netmask with the given host address, thus turning on all the host
	bits.

	bridge: Fix uninitialized variable

2010-12-24  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Replace setuid/setgid/initgroups with virSetUIDGID()
	This patch fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=664406

	If qemu is run as a different uid, it has been unable to access mode
	0660 files that are owned by a different user, but with a group that
	the qemu is a member of (aside from the one group listed in the passwd
	file), because initgroups() is not being called prior to the
	exec. initgroups will change the group membership of the process (and
	its children) to match the new uid.

	To make this happen, the setregid()/setreuid() code in
	qemuSecurityDACSetProcessLabel has been replaced with a call to
	virSetUIDGID(), which does both of those, plus calls initgroups.

	Similar, but not identical, code in qemudOpenAsUID() has been replaced
	with virSetUIDGID(). This not only consolidates the functionality to a
	single location, but also potentially fixes some as-yet unreported
	bugs.

	new virSetUIDGID() utility function
	virSetUIDGID() sets both the real and effective group and user of the
	process, and additionally calls initgroups() to assure that the
	process joins all the auxiliary groups that the given uid is a member
	of.

	Preserve errno across calls to error reporting functions & VIR_FREE
	There are cases when we want log an error message, and possibly free
	some memory as part of the cleanup, while still preserving errno for a
	caller, but the functions that log errors, and virFree (VIR_FREE) make
	system calls that will clear errno. This patch preserves errno during
	those most basic functions (corresponding to virReportSystemError(),
	virReportOOMError(), networkReportError(), etc, as well as
	virStrError()). It does *not preserve errno across calls to higher
	level items such as virDispatchError(), as it's assumed the caller is
	all finished with any need for errno by the time it dispatches the
	error.

	Run radvd for virtual networks with IPv6 addresses
	Running an instance of the router advertisement daemon (radvd) allows
	guests using the virtual network to automatically acquire an IPv6
	address and default route. Note that acquiring an address only works
	for networks with a prefix length of exactly 64 - radvd is still run
	in other circumstances, and still advertises routes, but autoconf will
	not work because it requires exactly 64 bits of address info from the
	network prefix.

	This patch avoids a race condition with the pidfile by manually
	daemonizing radvd rather than allowing it to daemonize itself, then
	creating our own pidfile (in addition to radvd's own file, which is
	unnecessary, but there is no way to tell radvd to not create it). This
	is accomplished by exec'ing it with "--debug 1" in the commandline,
	and using virCommand's features to fork, create a pidfile, and detach
	from the newly forked process.

	Turn on IPv6 support in the bridge_driver.c virtual network driver
	At this point everything is already in place to make IPv6 happen, we just
	need to add a few rules, remove some checks for IPv4-only, and document
	the changes to the XML on the website.

	Update iptables.c to also support ip6tables.
	All of the iptables functions eventually call down to a single
	bottom-level function, and fortunately, ip6tables syntax (for all the
	args that we use) is identical to iptables format (except the
	addresses), so all we need to do is:

	1) Get an address family down to the lowest level function in each
	   case, either implied through an address, or explicitly when no
	   address is in the parameter list, and

	2) At the lowest level, just decide whether to call "iptables" or
	   "ip6tables" based on the family.

	The location of the ip6tables binary is determined at build time by
	autoconf. If a particular target system happens to not have ip6tables
	installed, any attempts to run it will generate an error, but that
	won't happen unless someone tries to define an IPv6 address for a
	network. This is identical behavior to IPv4 addresses and iptables.

	Support multiple IP addresses on one network in bridge_driver.c
	This patch reorganizes the code in bridge_driver.c to account for the
	concept of a single network with multiple IP addresses, without adding
	in the extra variable of IPv6. A small bit of code has been
	temporarily added that checks all given addresses to verify they are
	IPv4 - this will be removed when full IPv6 support is turned on.

	Change virtual network XML parsing/formatting to support IPv6
	This commit adds support for IPv6 parsing and formatting to the
	virtual network XML parser, including moving around data definitions
	to allow for multiple <ip> elements on a single network, but only
	changes the consumers of this API to accommodate for the changes in
	API/structure, not to add any actual IPv6 functionality. That will
	come in a later patch - this patch attempts to maintain the same final
	functionality in both drivers that use the network XML parser - vbox
	and "bridge" (the Linux bridge-based driver used by the qemu
	hypervisor driver).

	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Add new private API functions.
	* src/conf/network_conf.[ch]: Change C data structure and
	  parsing/formatting.
	* src/network/bridge_driver.c: Update to use new parser/formatter.
	* src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c: update to use new parser/formatter
	* docs/schemas/network.rng: changes to the schema -
	  * there can now be more than one <ip> element.
	  * ip address is now an ip-addr (ipv4 or ipv6) rather than ipv4-addr
	  * new optional "prefix" attribute that can be used in place of "netmask"
	  * new optional "family" attribute - "ipv4" or "ipv6"
	    (will default to ipv4)
	  * define data types for the above
	* tests/networkxml2xml(in|out)/nat-network.xml: add multiple <ip> elements
	  (including IPv6) to a single network definition to verify they are being
	  correctly parsed and formatted.

	make the <dhcp> element optional in network.rng
	In practice this has always been optional, but the RNG has shown it as
	mandatory, and since all the examples for make check had it, it was
	never noticed. One of the existing test cases has been changed to
	check for this.

	I also noticed that the dhcp/host/ip was still defined as <text/>,
	but should really be <ref name='ipv4-addr'/>

	Replace brSetInetAddress/brSetInetNetmask with brAddInetAddress
	brSetInetAddress can only set a single IP address on the bridge, and
	uses a method (ioctl(SIOCSETIFADDR)) that only works for IPv4. Replace
	it and brSetInetNetmask with a single function that uses the external
	"ip addr add" command to add an address/prefix to the interface - this
	supports IPv6, and allows adding multiple addresses to the interface.

	Although it isn't currently used in the code, we also add a
	brDelInetAddress for completeness' sake.

	Also, while we're modifying bridge.c, we change brSetForwardDelay and
	brSetEnableSTP to use the new virCommand API rather than the
	deprecated virRun, and also log an error message in bridge_driver.c if
	either of those fail (previously the failure would be completely
	silent).

	Make virtual network netmasks optional
	When a netmask isn't specified for an IPv4 address, one can be implied
	based on what network class range the address is in. The
	virNetworkDefPrefix function does this for us, so netmask isn't
	required.

	Pass prefix rather than netmask into iptables functions
	IPv6 will use prefix exclusively, and IPv4 will also optionally be
	able to use it, and the iptables functions really need a prefix
	anyway, so use the new virNetworkDefPrefix() function to send prefixes
	into iptables functions instead of netmasks.

	Also, in a couple places where a netmask is actually needed, use the
	new private API function for it rather than getting it directly. This
	will allow for cases where no netmask or prefix is specified (it
	returns the default for the current class of network.)

	Consistently return 0 on success, -1 on failure in bridge_driver.c
	Some functions in this file were returning 1 on success and 0 on
	failure, and others were returning 0 on success and -1 on
	failure. Switch them all to return the libvirt-preferred 0/-1.

	Fix logging of failed iptables commands
	The functions in iptables.c all return -1 on failure, but all their
	callers (which all happen to be in bridge_driver.c) assume that they
	are returning an errno, and the logging is done accordingly. This
	patch fixes all the error checking and logging to assume < 0 is an
	error, and nothing else.

	New virNetworkDef utility functions
	Later patches will add the possibility to define a network's netmask
	as a prefix (0-32, or 0-128 in the case of IPv6). To make it easier to
	deal with definition of both kinds (prefix or netmask), add two new
	functions:

	virNetworkDefNetmask: return a copy of the netmask into a
	virSocketAddr. If no netmask was specified in the XML, create a
	default netmask based on the network class of the virNetworkDef's IP
	address.

	virNetworkDefPrefix: return the netmask as numeric prefix (or the
	default prefix for the network class of the virNetworkDef's IP
	address, if no netmask was specified in the XML)

	New virSocketAddr utility functions
	virSocketPrefixToNetmask: Given a 'prefix', which is the number of 1
	bits in a netmask, fill in a virSocketAddr object with a netmask as an
	IP address (IPv6 or IPv4).

	virSocketAddrMask: Mask off the host bits in one virSocketAddr
	according to the netmask in another virSocketAddr.

	virSocketAddrMaskByPrefix, Mask off the host bits in a virSocketAddr
	according to a prefix (number of 1 bits in netmask).

	VIR_SOCKET_FAMILY: return the family of a virSocketAddr

	qemu: Reparent children when deleting a snapshot
	Shorten qemuDomainSnapshotWriteSnapshotMetadata function name
	and make it take a snapshot pointer instead of dealing with
	the current snapshot. Update other functions accordingly.

	Add a qemuDomainSnapshotReparentChildren hash iterator to
	reparent the children of a snapshot that is being deleted. Use
	qemuDomainSnapshotWriteMetadata to write updated metadata
	to disk.

	This fixes a problem where outdated parent information breaks

	Set bitmap size when allocating a bitmap
	I began noticing a race when reserving VNC ports as described here

	https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2010-November/msg00379.html

	Turns out that we were not initializing the size field of bitmap
	struct when allocating the bitmap.  This subsequently caused
	virBitmapSetBit() to fail since bitmap->size is 0, hence we never
	actually reserved the port.

	cpu: Unify CPUID data structures
	So far, CPUID data were stored in two different data structures. First
	of them was a structure allowing direct access for CPUID data according
	to function number and the second was a plain array of struct
	cpuX86cpuid. This was a silly design which resulted in converting data
	from one type to the other and back again or implementing similar
	functionality for both data structures.

	The patch leaves only the direct access structure. This makes the code

	qemu: Introduce two new job types
	Currently, all of domain "save/dump/managed save/migration"
	use the same function "qemudDomainWaitForMigrationComplete"
	to wait the job finished, but the error messages are all
	about "migration", e.g. when a domain saving job is canceled
	by user, "migration was cancled by client" will be throwed as
	an error message, which will be confused for user.

	As a solution, intoduce two new job types(QEMU_JOB_SAVE,
	QEMU_JOB_DUMP), and set "priv->jobActive" to "QEMU_JOB_SAVE"
	before saving, to "QEMU_JOB_DUMP" before dumping, so that we
	could get the real job type in
	"qemudDomainWaitForMigrationComplete", and give more clear
	message further.

	And as It's not important to figure out what's the exact job
	is in the DEBUG and WARN log, also we don't need translated
	string in logs, simply repace "migration" with "job" in some
	statements.

	Convert dhcpStartDhcpDaemon from virRun to virCommand
	This is pretty straightforward - even though dnsmasq gets daemonized
	and uses a pid file, those things are both handled by the dnsmasq
	binary itself. And libvirt doesn't need any of the output of the
	dnsmasq command either, so we just setup the args and call
	virRun(). Mainly it was just a (mostly) mechanical job of replacing
	the APPEND_ARG() macro (and some other *printfs()) with
	virCommandAddArg*().

	esx: Refactor storage pool type lookup into a function

	esx: Improve error reporting for failed tasks
	Instead of just reporting that a task failed get the
	localized message from the TaskInfo error and include
	it in the reported error message.

	Implement minimal deserialization support for the
	MethodFault type in order to obtain the actual fault
	type.

	For example, this changes the reported error message
	when trying to create a volume with zero size from

	  Could not create volume

	to

	  Could not create volume: InvalidArgument - A specified parameter was not correct.

	Not perfect yet, but better than before.

	qemu: Distinguish between domain shutdown and crash
	When we get an EOF event on monitor connection, it may be a result of
	either crash or graceful shutdown. QEMU which supports async events
	(i.e., we are talking to it using JSON monitor) emits SHUTDOWN event on
	graceful shutdown. In case we don't get this event by the time monitor
	connection is closed, we assume the associated domain crashed.

	qemu: call drive_del in DetachPciDiskDevice
	Currently libvirt doesn't confirm whether the guest has responded to the
	disk removal request.  In some cases this can leave the guest with
	continued access to the device while the mgmt layer believes that it has
	been removed.  With a recent qemu monitor command[1] we can
	deterministically revoke a guests access to the disk (on the QEMU side)
	to ensure no futher access is permitted.

	This patch adds support for the drive_del() command and introduces it
	in the disk removal paths.  If the guest is running in a QEMU without this
	command we currently explicitly check for unknown command/CommandNotFound
	and log the issue.

	If QEMU supports the command we issue the drive_del command after we attempt
	to remove the device.  The guest may respond and remove the block device
	before we get to attempt to call drive_del.  In that case, we explicitly check
	for 'Device not found' from the monitor indicating that the target drive
	was auto-deleted upon guest responds to the device removal notification.

	to handle the case where the guest is running in a QEMU without this
	command (and the fact that we currently don't have a way of detecting
	what monitor commands are available).

	Changes since v2:
	 - use VIR_ERROR to report when unplug command not found
	Changes since v1:
	 - return > 0 when command isn't present, < 0 on command failure
	 - detect when drive_unplug command isn't present and log error
	   instead of failing entire command

	command: improve behavior on no output
	Guarantee that outbuf/errbuf are allocated on success, even if to the

	qemu: avoid adding "" in smbios arguments
	The log lists things like -smbios type=1,vendor="Red Hat", which

	line argument, such that qemu sets SMBIOS with extra literal quotes.

	The eventual addition of virCommand is needed before we have the API
	to shell-quote a string representation of a command line, so that the
	log can still be pasted into a shell, but without inserting extra
	bytes into the execve() arguments.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c (qemuBuildSmbiosBiosStr)
	(qemuBuildSmbiosSystemStr): Qemu doesn't like quotes around uuid
	arguments, and the remaining quotes are passed literally to

	quotes makes the log harder to parse, but that can be fixed later
	with virCommand improvements.
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-smbios.args: 'Fix' test; it

	tests: Add tests for CPU selection in qemu driver

	tests: Support for faking emulator in qemuxml2argv
	This patch allows for using custom scripts instead of /usr/bin/qemu
	emulator in domain XML. To do so, one would specify relative path to the
	custom script in <emulator/>. The path needs to be relative to
	qemuxml2argvdata directory and it will be transparently made absolute in
	runtime. The expected command line needs to contain the exact relative
	path as was used in domain XML.

	The problem is RelaxNG schema for domain XML only allows for absolute
	path within <emulator/>. To workaround it, an extra '/' must be added at
	the beginning of the path. That is, instead of "./qemu.sh" or
	"../emulator/qemu.sh" one would use "/./qemu.sh" or
	"/../emulator/qemu.sh". The extra slash is removed before further
	processing. I don't like this workaround, it's very ugly but it's the
	best option I was able to come up with. Relaxing domain XML schema is

	802.1Qbg: use pre-associate state at beginning of inc. migr
	This patch introduces the usage of the pre-associate state of the IEEE 802.1Qbg standard on incoming VM migration on the target host. It is in response to bugzilla entry 632750.

	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=632750

	For being able to differentiate the exact reason as to why a macvtap device is being created, either due to a VM creation or an incoming VM migration, I needed to pass that reason as a parameter from wherever qemudStartVMDaemon is being called in order to determine whether to send an ASSOCIATE (VM creation) or a PRE-ASSOCIATE (incoming VM migration) towards lldpad.

	I am also fixing a problem with the virsh domainxml-to-native call on the way.

	Gerhard successfully tested the patch with a recent blade network 802.1Qbg-compliant switch.

	The patch should not have any side-effects on the 802.1Qbh support in libvirt, but Roopa (cc'ed) may want to verify this.

	    error: Failed to define domain from 110.xml
	    error: internal error Could not set UUID

	Since silently ignoring vmdef->name is not nice respect it instead. We

2010-11-25  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Fix host CPU counting on unusual NUMA topologies
	The nodeinfo structure includes

	    nodes   : the number of NUMA cell, 1 for uniform mem access
	    sockets : number of CPU socket per node
	    cores   : number of core per socket
	    threads : number of threads per core

	which does not work well for NUMA topologies where each node does not
	consist of integral number of CPU sockets.

	We also have VIR_NODEINFO_MAXCPUS macro in public libvirt.h which
	computes maximum number of CPUs as (nodes * sockets * cores * threads).

	As a result, we can't just change sockets to report total number of
	sockets instead of sockets per node. This would probably be the easiest
	since I doubt anyone is using the field directly. But because of the
	macro, some apps might be using sockets indirectly.

	This patch leaves sockets to be the number of CPU sockets per node (and
	fixes qemu driver to comply with this) on machines where sockets can be
	divided by nodes. If we can't divide sockets by nodes, we behave as if
	there was just one NUMA node containing all sockets. Apps interested in
	NUMA should consult capabilities XML, which is what they probably do
	anyway.

	This way, the only case in which apps that care about NUMA may break is
	on machines with funky NUMA topology. And there is a chance libvirt
	wasn't able to start any guests on those machines anyway (although it
	depends on the topology, total number of CPUs and kernel version).
	Nothing changes at all for apps that don't care about NUMA.

	security, storage: plug memory leaks for security_context_t
	security_context_t happens to be a typedef for char*, and happens to
	begin with a string usable as a raw context string.  But in reality,
	it is an opaque type that may or may not have additional information
	after the first NUL byte, where that additional information can
	include pointers that can only be freed via freecon().

	Proof is from this valgrind run of daemon/libvirtd:

	==6028== 839,169 (40 direct, 839,129 indirect) bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 274 of 274

	Always close drivers when a virConnectPtr is released
	virConnectClose calls virUnrefConnect which in turn closes
	all open drivers when the refcount of that connection dropped
	to zero. This works fine when you free all other objects that
	hold a ref to the connection before you close it, because in
	this case virUnrefConnect is the one that removes the last
	ref to the connection.

	But it doesn't work when you close the connection first before
	freeing the other objects. This is because the other virUnref*
	functions call virReleaseConnect when they detect that the
	connection's refcount dropped to zero. In this case another
	virUnref* function (different from virUnrefConnect) removes the
	last ref to the connection. This results in not closing the
	open drivers and leaking things that should have been cleaned
	up in the driver close functions.

	To fix this move the driver close calls to virReleaseConnect.

	remote: Fix TLS transport on Windows
	gnulib wraps Windows' SOCKET handle based send() and recv() functions
	into file descriptor based ones that are used in libvirt.

	Even though GnuTLS is using gnulib too, it explicitly doesn't use
	gnulib's replacement functions on Windows. By default GnuTLS uses the
	SOCKET handle based send() and recv(). This makes gnutls_handshake()
	fail internally with a WSAENOTSOCK error because libvirt passes a
	file descriptor; GnuTLS needs the SOCKET handle.

	To avoid this mismatch make sure that GnuTLS uses gnulib's replacment
	functions, by setting custom pull() and push() functions for GnuTLS.

	Fix error handling in virsh when listing storage volumes
	virsh was not checking for a error code when listing storage
	volumes. So when listing volumes in a pool that was shutoff,
	no output was displayed

	* tools/virsh.c: Fix error handling when listing volumes

	Improve SCSI volume name generation
	The SCSI volumes currently get a name like '17:0:0:1' based
	on $host:$bus:$target:$lun. The names are intended to be unique
	per pool and stable across pool restarts. The inclusion of the
	$host component breaks this, because the $host number for iSCSI
	pools is dynamically allocated by the kernel at time of login.
	This changes the name to be 'unit:0:0:1', ie removes the leading
	host component. The 'unit:' prefix is just to ensure the volume
	name doesn't start with a number and make it clearer when seen
	out of context.

	* src/storage/storage_backend_scsi.c: Improve volume name
	  field value stability and uniqueness

	Fix error codes returned when a storage pool is inactive
	Many operations are not valid on inactive storage pools. The
	storage driver is currently returning VIR_ERR_INTERNAL_ERROR
	in these cases, rather than the more suitable error code
	VIR_ERR_OPERATION_INVALID

	* src/storage/storage_driver.c: Fix error code when pool
	  is not active

	Check whether pools are already active upon libvirtd startup
	When libvirt starts up all storage pools default to the inactive
	state, even if the underlying storage is already active on the
	host. This introduces a new API into the internal storage backend
	drivers that checks whether a storage pool is already active. If
	the pool is active at libvirtd startup, the volume list will be
	immediately populated.

	* src/storage/storage_backend.h: New internal API for checking
	  storage pool state
	* src/storage/storage_driver.c: Check whether a pool is active
	  upon driver startup
	* src/storage/storage_backend_fs.c, src/storage/storage_backend_iscsi.c,

	  src/storage/storage_backend_scsi.c: Add checks for pool state

	Remove bogus port handling code in virsh
	The "find-storage-pool-sources-as" command takes two arguments,
	a hostname and a port number. For some reason the code would
	also then look for a port number appended to the hostname
	string by searching for ':'. This totally breaks if the user
	gives an IPv6 address, and is redundant, since you can already
	provide a port as a separate argument

	* tools/virsh.c: Remove bogus port number handling code

	Allow iSCSI IQN to be set with find-storage-pool-sources-as command
	Allow an iSCSI initiator IQN to be set with the XML for the
	find-storage-pool-sources-as virsh command

	* tools/virsh.c: Add iSCSI IQN support

	Switch the virsh XML generation to use virBuffer instead of virAsprintf
	The code generating XML for storage pool source discovery is
	hardcoded to only allow a hostname and optional port number.
	Refactor this code to make it easier to add support for extra
	parameters.

	* tools/virsh.c: Refactor XML generator

	Add support for iSCSI target auto-discovery
	Since the previous patch added support for parsing the output of
	the 'sendtargets' command, it is now trivial to support the
	storage pool discovery API.

	Given a hostname and optional portnumber and initiator IQN,
	the code can return a full list of storage pool source docs,
	each one representing a iSCSI target.

	* src/storage/storage_backend_iscsi.c: Wire up target
	  auto-discovery

	Stop iSCSI targets automatically logging back in after logout
	The Linux iSCSI initiator toolchain has the dubious feature that
	if you ever run the 'sendtargets' command to merely query what
	targets are available from a server, the results will be recorded
	in /var/lib/iscsi. Any time the '/etc/init.d/iscsi' script runs
	in the future, it will then automatically login to all those
	targets. /etc/init.d/iscsi is automatically run whenever a NIC
	comes online.

	So from the moment you ask a server what targets are available,
	your client will forever more automatically try to login to all
	targets without ever asking if you actually want it todo this.

	To stop this stupid behaviour, we need to run

	  iscsiadm --portal $PORTAL --target $TARGET
	   --op update --name node.startup --value manual

	For every target on the server.

	* src/storage/storage_backend_iscsi.c: Disable automatic login
	  for targets found as a result of a 'sendtargets' command

	Refactor iSCSI driver code to facilitate future changes
	The following series of patches are adding significant
	extra functionality to the iSCSI driver. THe current
	internal helper methods are not sufficiently flexible
	to cope with these changes. This patch refactors the
	code to avoid needing to have a virStoragePoolObjPtr
	instance as a parameter, instead passing individual
	target, portal and initiatoriqn parameters.

	It also removes hardcoding of port 3260 in the portal
	address, instead using the XML value if any.

	* src/storage/storage_backend_iscsi.c: Refactor internal
	  helper methods

	Fix parsing of port attribute in storage XML configuration
	The XML docs describe a 'port' attribute for the
	storage source <host> element, but the parser never
	handled it.

	* docs/schemas/storagepool.rng: Define port attribute
	* src/conf/storage_conf.c: Add missing parsing/formatting
	  of host port number
	* src/conf/storage_conf.h: Remove bogus/unused 'protocol' field

	Don't catch SIGCHLD in libvirtd
	libvirtd no longer deals with SIGCHLD in its signal handler
	since the QEMU driver switched to always daemonize processes.
	Thus remove the sigaction for it, to avoid warning log
	messages

	* daemon/libvirtd.c: Don't catch SIGCHLD

	Ensure logfile isn't truncated by shutdown message.
	When running non-root, the QEMU log file is usually opened with
	truncation, since there is no logrotate for non-root usage.
	This means that when libvirt logs the shutdown timestamp, the
	log is accidentally truncated

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Never truncate log file with shutdown
	  message

	Remove trailing ':' from timestamp
	The QEMU logger appends a ':' to the timestamp when it deems
	it neccessary, so the virTimestamp API should not duplicate
	this

	* src/util/util.c: Remove trailing ':' from timestamp

	Log all errors at level INFO to stop polluting syslog
	Everytime a public API returns an error, libvirtd pollutes
	syslog with that error message. Reduce the error logging
	level to INFO so these don't appear by default.

	* src/util/virterror.c: Log all errors at INFO

	Ensure virExec preserves logging environment
	The virFork call resets all logging handlers that may have been
	set. Re-enable them after fork in virExec, so that env variables
	fir LIBVIRT_LOG_OUTPUTS and LIBVIRT_LOG_FILTERS take effect
	until the execve()

	* src/util/util.c: Preserve logging in child in virExec

	Include a thread identifier in log messages
	To allow messages from different threads to be untangled,
	include an integer thread identifier in log messages.

	* src/util/logging.c: Include thread ID
	* src/util/threads.h, src/util/threads.h, src/util/threads-pthread.c:
	  Add new virThreadSelfID() function
	* configure.ac: Check for sys/syscall.h

	qemu: setvcpus: Save config changes to disk
	Currently changes to the persistent config aren't flushed to disk, meaning
	they are lost if the domain is redefined or libvirtd is restarted.

	qemu: setvcpus: Simplify altering the persistent config
	Do this by adding a helper function to get the persistent domain config. This
	should be useful for other functions that may eventually want to alter
	the persistent domain config (attach/detach device). Also make similar changes
	to the test drivers setvcpus command.

	A caveat is that the function will return the running config for a transient
	domain, rather than error. This simplifies callers, as long as they use
	other methods to ensure the guest is persistent.

	qemu: setvcpus: Fix maxvcpus check
	Doing 'virsh setvcpus $vm --config 10' doesn't check the value against the
	domains maxvcpus value. A larger value for example will prevent the guest
	from starting.

	Also make a similar change to the test driver.

	conf: domain: Improve vcpus validation reporting

	Make state driver device hotplug/update actually transient
	The current semantics of non-persistent hotplug/update are confusing: the
	changes will persist as long as the in memory domain definition isn't
	overwritten. This means hotplug changes stay around until the domain is
	redefined or libvirtd is restarted.

	Call virDomainObjSetDefTransient at VM startup, so that we properly discard
	hotplug changes when the VM is shutdown.

	domain_conf: Add virDomainObjSetDefTransient
	This function sets the running domain definition as transient, by reparsing
	the persistent config and assigning it to newDef. This ensures that any
	changes made to the running definition and not the persistent config are
	discarded when the VM is shutdown.

	xend: Escape reserved sexpr characters
	If we don't escape ' or \ xend can't parse the generated sexpr. This
	might over apply the EscapeSexpr routine, but it shouldn't hurt.

	buf: Simplify virBufferEscapeString
	We are about to copy this function, so clean it up before we do.

	xend: urlencode: Properly escape '&'
	Since we send the sexpr to xend via HTTP, we need to properly escape
	'&'

	conf: Fix parsing python style triple quotes
	An incorrect check broke matching the closing set of quotes. Update
	tests to cover this case for XM config files.

	conf: Convert ParseString to use STRPREFIX

	schemas: domain: Add more valid file path chars
	Also, standardize path usage on 'filePath' and 'absFilePath'

	maint: tighten strncmp syntax check
	Using 'int ret = strcmp(a, b)' in a qsort function is a valid use of
	str[n]cmp that should _not_ be turned to STREQ, but it was falling
	foul of our specific syntax-check.  Meanwhile, gnulib's maint.mk
	already has a tighter bound for strcmp, so we can copy that regex and

	require exceptions.

	calls bindtextdomain(), but this is insufficient without the
	setlocale() added in this patch; and a redundant bindtextdomain()
	in this patch doesn't hurt, but serves as a good example for other

	replace last instances of close()
	I am replacing the last instances of close() I found with VIR_CLOSE() / VIR_FORCE_CLOSE respectively.

	The first part patches virsh, which I missed out on previously.

	The 2nd patch I had left out intentionally to look at it more carefully:
	The 'closed' variable could be easily removed since it wasn't used anywhere else. The possible race condition that could result from the filedescriptor being closed and not set to -1 (and possibly let us write into 'something' totally different if the fd was allocated by another thread) seems to be prevented by the qemuMonitorLock() already placed around the code that reads from or writes to the fd. So the change of this code as shown in the patch should not have any side-effects.

	nwfilter: also purge ip(6)tables rules before detecting IP address
	Rather than only cleaning any remaining ebtables rules, also clean those applied to iptables and ip6tables when detecting the IP address of an interface. Previous applied iptables rules may hinder DHCP packets.

	deprecate fclose() and introduce VIR_{FORCE_}FCLOSE()
	Similarly to deprecating close(), I am now deprecating fclose() and
	introduce VIR_FORCE_FCLOSE() and VIR_FCLOSE(). Also, fdopen() is replaced with
	VIR_FDOPEN().

	Most of the files are opened in read-only mode, so usage of
	VIR_FORCE_CLOSE() seemed appropriate. Others that are opened in write
	mode already had the fclose()<  0 check and I converted those to
	VIR_FCLOSE()<  0.

	I did not find occurrences of possible double-closed files on the way.

	Do a better job of validating IP and MAC addresses in network.rng
	IP addresses and MAC addresses had been defined in the RNG simply as
	<text/> meaning that, according to the RNG, any string could go in
	there. Of course the C parsing code does a much better job of
	validating, but we may as well have this describing the contents
	accurately (even though it's currently only used during "make check").

	This commit is whitespace changes only, do avoid obscuring actual code
	changes.

	Put network.rng contents inside <grammar> for uniformity with other RNGs
	All the other RNG files in libvirt are enclosed within <grammar>. This

	definitions to network.rng for more exact validation of IP and MAC
	addresses).

	remote_driver.c: fix non-literal format strings w/o args

	ignore SELinuxSetFilecon error in SELinuxSetSecurityFileLabel if on nfs
	If virDomainAttachDevice() was called with an image that was located
	on a root-squashed NFS server, and in a directory that was unreadable
	by root on the machine running libvirtd, the attach would fail due to
	an attempt to change the selinux label of the image with EACCES (which
	isn't covered as an ignore case in SELinuxSetFilecon())

	NFS doesn't support SELinux labelling anyway, so we mimic the failure
	handling of commit 93a18bbafaf11729d3ca1241e11bee133d77fa77, which
	just ignores the errors if the target is on an NFS filesystem (in
	SELinuxSetSecurityAllLabel() only, though.)

	This can be seen as a follow-on to commit
	347d266c51705f4987fa5ce2a0ecb314ed8745ce, which ignores file open
	failures of files on NFS that occur directly in
	virDomainDiskDefForeachPath() (also necessary), but does not ignore
	failures in functions that are called from there (eg
	SELinuxSetSecurityFileLabel()).

	Fix reference counting bug in virsh console
	The event watches need to be removed before the event loop
	terminates, otherwise they cause a dangling reference to
	be held on the virStreamPtr, which in turns holds a reference
	on virConnectPtr, which in turn causes errors like

	  "Failed to disconnect from the hypervisor"

	* tools/console.c: Remove watches before event loop quits
	* tools/virsh.c: Print out dangling reference count

	Wire up virDomainOpenConsole for LXC, Xen and UML
	Introduce implementations of the virDomainOpenConsole() API
	for LXC, Xen and UML drivers.

	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c, src/lxc/lxc_driver.c,
	  src/xen/xen_driver.c: Wire up virDomainOpenConsole

	Fix busy-wait loop on closed file descriptor
	When closing open streams after a client quits, the event
	callback was not removed. This mean that poll() was using
	a closed FD and returning POLLNVAL in a busy-wait loop.

	* daemon/stream.c: Disconnect stream callbacks

	Re-write virsh console to use streams
	This re-writes the 'virsh console' command so that it uses
	the new streams API. This lets it run remotely and/or as a
	non-root user. This requires that virsh be linked against
	the simple event loop from libvirtd in daemon/event.c
	As an added bonus, it can now connect to any console device,
	not just the first one.

	* tools/Makefile.am: Link to event.c
	* tools/console.c, tools/console.h: Rewrite to use the
	  virDomainOpenConsole() APIs with streams
	* tools/virsh.c: Support choosing the console name
	  via --devname $NAME

	Convert daemon/events.c to use virMutex and virThread
	The code currently uses pthreads APIs directly. This is not
	portable to Win32 threads. Switch it over to use the portability
	APIs. Also add a wrapper for pipe() which is subtely different
	on Win32

	* daemon/event.c: Switch to use virMutex & virThread.

	Introduce portability APIs for creating threads
	The util/threads.c/h code already has APIs for mutexes,
	condition variables and thread locals. This commit adds
	in code for actually creating threads.

	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Export new symbols
	* src/util/threads.h: Define APIs virThreadCreate, virThreadSelf,
	  virThreadIsSelf and virThreadJoin
	* src/util/threads-win32.c, src/util/threads-win32.h: Win32
	  impl of threads
	* src/util/threads-pthread.c, src/util/threads-pthread.h: POSIX
	  impl of threads

	Support virDomainOpenConsole with QEMU
	This provides an implementation of the virDomainOpenConsole
	API with the QEMU driver. For the streams code, this reuses
	most of the code previously added for the tunnelled migration
	streams since it is generic.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Support virDomainOpenConsole

	Add a generic internal API for handling any FD based stream
	To avoid the need for duplicating implementations of virStream
	drivers, provide a generic implementation that can handle any
	FD based stream. This code is copied from the existing impl
	in the QEMU driver, with the locking moved into the stream
	impl, and addition of a read callback

	The FD stream code will refuse to operate on regular files or
	block devices, since those can't report EAGAIN properly when
	they would block on I/O

	* include/libvirt/virterror.h, include/libvirt/virterror.h: Add
	  VIR_FROM_STREAM error domain
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Remove code obsoleted by the new
	  generic streams driver.
	* src/fdstream.h, src/fdstream.c, src/fdstream.c,
	  src/libvirt_private.syms: Generic reusable FD based streams

	Lower logging level in remote driver streams
	Now that bi-directional, non-blocking streams are supported
	in the remote driver, some of the VIR_WARN statements need
	to be reduced to VIR_DEBUG.

	* src/remote/remote_driver.c: Lower logging level

	Remote driver client and server for virDomainOpenConsole
	This provides an implementation of the virDomainOpenConsole
	API for the remote driver client and server.

	* daemon/remote.c: Server side impl
	* src/remote/remote_driver.c: Client impl
	* src/remote/remote_protocol.x: Wire definition

	Introduce a virDomainOpenConsole API
	To enable virsh console (or equivalent) to be used remotely
	it is necessary to provide remote access to the /dev/pts/XXX
	pseudo-TTY associated with the console/serial/parallel device
	in the guest. The virStream API provide a bi-directional I/O
	stream capability that can be used for this purpose. This
	patch thus introduces a virDomainOpenConsole API that uses
	the stream APIs.

	* src/libvirt.c, src/libvirt_public.syms,
	  include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in, src/driver.h: Define the
	  new virDomainOpenConsole API
	* src/esx/esx_driver.c, src/lxc/lxc_driver.c,
	  src/opennebula/one_driver.c, src/openvz/openvz_driver.c,
	  src/phyp/phyp_driver.c, src/qemu/qemu_driver.c,

	  src/uml/uml_driver.c, src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c,
	  src/xen/xen_driver.c, src/xenapi/xenapi_driver.c: Stub
	  API entry point

	Support callbacks on virStream APIs in remote driver client
	The current remote driver code for streams only supports
	blocking I/O mode. This is fine for the usage with migration
	but is a problem for more general use cases, in particular
	bi-directional streams.

	This adds supported for the stream callbacks and non-blocking
	I/O. with the minor caveat is that it doesn't actually do
	non-blocking I/O for sending stream data, only receiving it.
	A future patch will try to do non-blocking sends, but this is
	quite tricky to get right.

	* src/remote/remote_driver.c: Allow non-blocking I/O for
	  streams and support callbacks

	Fix LXC container console device setup
	The /dev/console device inside the container must NOT map
	to the real /dev/console device node, since this allows the
	container control over the current host console. A fun side
	effect of this is that starting a container containing a
	real Fedora OS will kill off your X server.

	Remove the /dev/console node, and replace it with a symlink

	Allow non-file disk backingStores
	I am trying to use a qcow image with libvirt where the backing 'file' is a
	qemu-nbd server.  Unfortunately virDomainDiskDefForeachPath() assumes that
	backingStore is always a real file so something like 'nbd:0:3333' is rejected
	because a file with that name cannot be accessed.  Note that I am not worried
	about directly using nbd images.  That would require a new disk type with XML
	markup, etc.  I only want it to be permitted as a backingStore

	The following patch implements danpb's suggestion:
	> I think I'm inclined to push the logic for skipping NBD one stage higher.
	> I'd rather expect virStorageFileGetMetadata() to return all backing
	> stores, even if not files. The virDomainDiskDefForeachPath() method
	> should definitely ignore non-file backing stores though.
	>
	> So what I'm thinking is to extend the virStorageFileMetadata struct and
	> just add a 'bool isFile' field to it. Default this field to true, unless
	> you see the prefix of nbd: in which case set it to false. The
	> virDomainDiskDefForeachPath() method can then skip over any backing
	> store with isFile == false

	xencapstest: Don't fail when Xen is installed
	xencapstest calls xenHypervisorMakeCapabilitiesInternal with conn == NULL
	which calls xenDaemonNodeGetTopology with conn == NULL when a recent
	enough Xen was detected (sys_interface_version >= SYS_IFACE_MIN_VERS_NUMA).
	But xenDaemonNodeGetTopology insists in having conn != NULL and fails,
	because it expects to be able to talk to an actual xend.

	We cannot do that in a 'make check' test. Therefore, only call the xend
	subdriver function when conn isn't NULL.

	Support SPICE channel security options
	This extends the SPICE XML to allow channel security options

	    <graphics type='spice' port='-1' tlsPort='-1' autoport='yes'>
	      <channel name='main' mode='secure'/>
	      <channel name='record' mode='insecure'/>

	Any non-specified channel uses the default, which allows both
	secure & insecure usage

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h,

	Add a new test for sysinfo and smbios handling

	Add sysinfo/smbios support to the QEmu driver
	The patch is based on the possiblity in the QEmu command line to
	add -smbios options allowing to override the default values picked
	by QEmu. We need to detect this first from QEmu help output.
	If the domain is defined with smbios to be inherited from host
	then we pass the values coming from the Host own SMBIOS, but
	if the domain is defined with smbios to come from sysinfo, we
	use the ones coming from the domain definition.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: add the QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_SMBIOS_TYPE enum
	  value
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: scan the help output for the smbios support,
	  and if available add support based on the domain definitions,
	  and host data
	* tests/qemuhelptest.c: add the new enum in the outputs

	Read the host sysinfo for the QEmu driver
	Read and store the data when initializing the driver.

	Add a sysinfo util module and read host info API
	Move existing routines about virSysinfoDef to an util module,

	with dmidecode

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c src/conf/domain_conf.h src/util/sysinfo.c
	  src/util/sysinfo.h: move to a new module, add virSysinfoRead()
	* src/Makefile.am: handle the new module build
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: new internal symbols
	* include/libvirt/virterror.h src/util/virterror.c: defined a new
	  error code for that module
	* po/POTFILES.in: add new file for translations

	Add smbios element to schema and configuration to HVM os
	the element has a mode attribute allowing only 3 values:
	  - emulate: use the smbios emulation from the hypervisor
	  - host: try to use the smbios values from the node
	  - sysinfo: grab the values from the <sysinfo> fields

	* docs/schemas/domain.rng: extend the schemas
	* src/conf/domain_conf.h: add the flag to the domain config
	* src/conf/domain_conf.h: parse and serialize the smbios if present

	Sysinfo parsing and saving to/from configuration files
	* src/conf/domain_conf.h: defines a new internal type added to the

	macvtap: libvirtd forgot macvtap dev name when restarted
	During a shutdown/restart cycle libvirtd forgot the macvtap device name that it had created on behalf of a VM so that a stale macvtap device remained on the host when the VM terminated. Libvirtd has to actively tear down a macvtap device and it uses its name for identifying which device to tear down.

	The solution is to not blank out the <target dev='...'/> completely, but only blank it out on VMs that are not active. So, if a VM is active, the device name makes it into the XML and is also being parsed. If a VM is not active, the device name is discarded.

	virPipeReadUntilEOF is used to read the stdout of exec'ed

	  The problem is that this is based on a poll loop, and in the

	note in the loop if poll indicates that the process won't output
	more than that on that fd by setting finished[i] = 1.
	  The simplest way is that if we read a full buffer make sure

	remote.c: In function 'remoteDispatchAuthPolkit':
	remote.c:4177: error: 'rv' undeclared (first use in this function)

	Add missing identifier.

	Change calling conventions in remote driver client internals
	The remoteIO() method has wierd calling conventions, where
	it is passed a pre-allocated 'struct remote_call *' but
	then free()s it itself, instead of letting the caller free().
	This fixes those weird semantics

	* src/remote/remote_driver.c: Sanitize semantics of remoteIO
	  method wrt to memory release

	Fix comment for <video> tag in domain RNG schema
	The comment for the <video> tag was a cut+paste error duplicating
	info about the <graphics> tag

	* docs/schemas/domain.rng: Fix comment for <video> tag

	Misc error handling fixes in text mode monitor commands
	A couple of places in the text monitor were overwriting the
	'ret' variable with a >= 0 value before success was actually
	determined. So later error paths would not correctly return
	the -1 value. The drive_add code was not checking for errors
	like missing command

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c: Misc error handling fixes

	Ignore open failures when relabelling disk images
	NFS in root squash mode may prevent opening disk images to
	determine backing store. Ignore errors in this scenario.

	* src/security/security_selinux.c: Ignore open failures on disk
	  images

	Treat failure to relabel stdin_path as non-fatal on NFS
	NFS does not support file labelling, so ignore this error
	for stdin_path when on NFS.

	* src/security/security_selinux.c: Ignore failures on labelling
	  stdin_path on NFS
	* src/util/storage_file.c, src/util/storage_file.h: Refine
	  virStorageFileIsSharedFS() to allow it to check for a
	  specific FS type.

	Revert commit 06f81c63ebc19cb0e51f9b397991f6d6ae56d090
	Commit 06f81c63ebc19cb0e51f9b397991f6d6ae56d090 attempted to make
	QEMU driver ignore the failure to relabel 'stdin_path' if it was
	on NFS. The actual result was that it ignores *all* failures to
	label any aspect of the VM, unless stdin_path is non-NULL and
	is not on NFS.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Treat all relabel failures as terminal

	qemu: check compression program availability of virsh save and dump

	add compression support for "virsh dump"
	Add dump_image_format[] to qemu.conf and support compressed dump
	at virsh dump. coredump compression is important for saving disk space
	in an environment where multiple guests run.

	In general, "disk space for dump" is specially allocated and will be
	a dead space in the system. It's used only at emergency. So, it's better
	to have both of save_image_format and dump_image_format. "save" is done
	in scheduled manner with enough calculated disk space for it.

	This code reuses some of save_image_format[] and supports the same format.

	Changelog:
	 - modified libvirtd_qemu.aug
	 - modified test_libvirtd_qemu.aug
	 - fixed error handling of qemudSaveCompressionTypeFromString()

	qemu_driver: add virCgroupMounted
	When we mount any cgroup without "-o devices", we will fail to start vms:

	error: Failed to start domain vm1
	error: Unable to deny all devices for vm1: No such file or directory

	When we mount any cgroup without "-o cpu", we will fail to get schedinfo:
	Scheduler      : posix
	error: unable to get cpu shares tunable: No such file or directory

	We should only use the cgroup controllers which are mounted on host.

	vbox: Stop hardcoding a single path for VBoxXPCOMC.so
	This partly reverts df90ca7661b0a789bd790ccf8258a4527c13eb8d.

	Don't disable the VirtualBox driver when configure can't find
	VBoxXPCOMC.so, rely on detection at runtime again instead.

	Keep --with-vbox=/path/to/virtualbox intact, added to for:

	4. dynamic linker search path

	Also cleanup the glue code and improve error reporting.

	qemu: check for vm after starting a job
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=638285 - when migrating
	a guest, it was very easy to provoke a race where an application
	could query block information on a VM that had just been migrated
	away.  Any time qemu code obtains a job lock, it must also check
	that the VM was not taken down in the time where it was waiting
	for the lock.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemudDomainSetMemory)

	Only attempt removal of the rule allowing tftp if it was added
	During virtual network startup, the iptables rule that allows tftp
	traffic is only added if network->def->tftproot is non-empty, but when
	the virtual network is destroyed, we had been unconditionally trying
	to delete the rule. This was harmless, except that it created a bogus
	error message.

	This patch conditionalizes the delete command in the same manner that
	the insert command is already conditionalized.

	vbox: Fix compile errors due to the virSocketAddr series

2010-10-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Don't try to parse a NULL ip address for boot server
	The boot server IP address is optional, so it needs to be
	checked before attempting to parse it.

	* src/conf/network_conf.c: Don't parse NULL ip address for
	  boot server

	Convert virNetwork to use virSocketAddr everywhere
	Instead of storing the IP address string in virNetwork related
	structs, store the parsed virSocketAddr. This will make it
	easier to add IPv6 support in the future, by letting driver
	code directly check what address family is present

	* src/conf/network_conf.c, src/conf/network_conf.h,
	  src/network/bridge_driver.c: Convert to use virSocketAddr
	  in virNetwork, instead of char *.
	* src/util/bridge.c, src/util/bridge.h,
	  src/util/dnsmasq.c, src/util/dnsmasq.h,
	  src/util/iptables.c, src/util/iptables.h: Convert to
	  take a virSocketAddr instead of char * for any IP
	  address parameters
	* src/util/network.h: Add macros to determine if an address
	  is set, and what address family is set.

	Include socket address in client probe data
	It is useful to know where the client is connecting from,
	so include the socket address in probe data.

	* daemon/libvirtd.h: Use virSocketAddr for storing client
	  address and keep printable address handy for logging
	* daemon/libvirtd.c: Include socket address in client
	  connect/disconnect probes
	* daemon/probes.d: Add socket address to probes
	* examples/systemtap/client.stp: Print socket address
	* src/util/network.h: Add sockaddr_un to virSocketAddr union

	Add dtrace static probes in libvirtd
	Adds initial support for dtrace static probes in libvirtd
	daemon, assuming use of systemtap dtrace compat shim on
	Linux. The probes are inserted for network client connect,
	disconnect, TLS handshake states and authentication protocol
	states.

	This can be tested by running the xample program and then
	attempting to connect with any libvirt client (virsh,
	virt-manager, etc).

	 # stap examples/systemtap/client.stp
	  Client fd=44 connected readonly=0
	  Client fd=44 auth polkit deny pid:24997,uid:500
	  Client fd=44 disconnected
	  Client fd=46 connected readonly=1
	  Client fd=46 auth sasl allow test
	  Client fd=46 disconnected

	The libvirtd.stp file should also really not be required,
	since it is duplicated info that is already available in
	the main probes.d definition file. A script to autogenerate
	the .stp file is needed, either in libvirtd tree, or better
	as part of systemtap itself.

	* Makefile.am: Add examples/systemtap subdir
	* autobuild.sh: Disable dtrace for mingw32
	* configure.ac: Add check for dtrace
	* daemon/.gitignore: Ignore generated dtrace probe file
	* daemon/Makefile.am: Build dtrace probe header & object
	  files
	* daemon/libvirtd.stp: SystemTAP convenience probeset
	* daemon/libvirtd.c: Add connect/disconnect & TLS probes
	* daemon/remote.c: Add SASL and PolicyKit auth probes
	* daemon/probes.d: Master probe definition
	* daemon/libvirtd.h: Add convenience macro for probes
	  so that compilation is a no-op when dtrace is not available
	* examples/systemtap/Makefile.am, examples/systemtap/client.stp
	  Example systemtap script using dtrace probe markers
	* libvirt.spec.in: Enable dtrace on F13/RHEL6
	* mingw32-libvirt.spec.in: Force disable dtrace

	Add test suite for virSocket APIs
	Add a test suite for check parsing, formatting, range calculation
	and netmask checking APIs in virSocketAddr.

	* tests/sockettest.c, tests/Makefile.am: Add new test case

	Ban use of all inet_* functions
	All the inet_* functions can be replaced with calls to the
	virSocket APIs. Since many of the inet_* funtions are unsafe,
	and the remainder are obsolete, forbid all future use of them
	in libvirt.

	* Makefile.nonreentrant: Ban use of inet_*

	Remove all use of inet_pton and inet_ntop
	The  inet_pton and inet_ntop functions are obsolete, replaced
	by getaddrinfo+getnameinfo with the AI_NUMERICHOST flag set.
	These can be accessed via the virSocket APIs.

	The bridge.c code had methods for fetching the IP address of
	a bridge which used inet_ntop. Aside from the use of inet_ntop
	these methods are broken, because a NIC can have multiple
	addresses and this only returns one address. Since the methods
	are never used, just remove them.

	* src/conf/network_conf.c, src/nwfilter/nwfilter_learnipaddr.c:
	  Replace inet_pton and inet_ntop with virSocket APIs
	* src/util/bridge.c, src/util/bridge.h: Remove unused methods
	  which called inet_ntop.

	Remove both addrToString methods
	The addrToString functionality is now available via the
	virSocketFormatAddrFull method.

	* daemon/remote.c, src/remote/remote_driver.c: Remove
	  addrToString methods

	Fix error reporting for virSocketParse
	The virSocketParse method was not doing any error reporting
	which meant the true cause of the problem was lost. Remove
	all error reporting from callers, and push it into virSocketParse

	* src/util/network.c: Add error reporting to virSocketParse
	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/network_conf.c,
	  src/network/bridge_driver.c: Remove error reporting in
	  callers of virSocketParse

	Expand virSocketFormat to be more flexible
	The getnameinfo() function is more flexible than inet_ntop()
	avoiding the need to if/else the code based on socket family.
	Also make it support UNIX socket addrs and allow inclusion
	of a port (service) address. Finally do proper error reporting
	via normal APIs.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/nwfilter/nwfilter_ebiptables_driver.c,
	  src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Fix error handling with virSocketFormat
	* src/util/network.c: Rewrite virSocketFormat to use getnameinfo
	  and cope with UNIX socket addrs.

	Remove pointless nwIPAddress struct & void *casts
	The nwIPAddress was simply a wrapper about virSocketAddr.
	Just use the latter directly, removing all the extra field
	de-references from code & helper APIs for parsing/formatting.

	Also remove all the redundant casts from strong types to
	void * and then immediately back to strong types.

	* src/conf/nwfilter_conf.h: Remove nwIPAddress
	* src/conf/nwfilter_conf.c, src/nwfilter/nwfilter_ebiptables_driver.c:
	  Update to use virSocketAddr and remove void * casts.

	Fix netmask checks for IPv6 in virSocketCheckNetmask
	There was a typo in the IPv6 path of virSocketCheckNetmask which
	caused it to never execute.

	* src/util/network.c: s/AF_INET/AF_INET6/ in virSocketCheckNetmask

	Fix passing of address family to virSocketParseAddr
	The virSocketParseAddr function was accepting any AF_* constant
	and using that to set the ai_flags field in struct addrinfo.
	This is invalid, since address families must go in the ai_family
	field of the struct.

	* src/util/network.c: Fix handling of address family
	* src/conf/network_conf.c, src/network/bridge_driver.c: Pass
	  AF_UNSPEC instead of relying on it being 0.

	Include length with virSocketAddr data
	Some operations on socket addresses need to know the length of
	the sockaddr struct for the particular address family. This
	info was being discarded when passing around virSocketAddr
	instances. Turn it from a union into a struct containing
	union+socklen_t fields, so length is always kept around.

	* src/util/network.h: Add socklen_t field to virSocketAddr
	* src/util/network.c, src/network/bridge_driver.c,
	  src/conf/domain_conf.c: Update to take account of new
	  struct definition.

	Remove useless code in error path of getnameinfo()
	If getnameinfo() with NI_NUMERICHOST set fails, there are no
	grounds to expect inet_ntop to succeed, since these calls
	are functionally equivalent. Remove useless inet_ntop code
	in the getnameinfo() error path.

	* daemon/remote.c, src/remote/remote_driver.c: Remove
	  calls to inet_ntop

	Fix compile errors in remote.c and newly added audit code

2010-10-20  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix symbol exports & remove duplicated libvirt_util.la linkage
	The libvirt_util.la library was mistakenly linked into libvirtd
	directly. Since libvirt_util.la is already linked to libvirt.so,
	this resulted in libvirtd getting two copies of the code and
	more critically 2 copies of static global variables.

	Testing in turn exposed a issue with loadable modules. The
	gnulib replacement functions are not exported to loadable
	modules. Rather than trying to figure out the name sof all
	gnulib functions & export them, just linkage all loadable
	modules against libgnu.la statically.

	* daemon/Makefile.am: Remove linkage of libvirt_util.la
	  and libvirt_driver.la
	* src/Makefile.am: Link driver modules against libgnu.la
	* src/libvirt.c: Don't try to load modules which were
	  compiled out
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Export all other internal
	  symbols that are required  by drivers

2010-10-20  Miloslav Trmač  <mitr@redhat.com>

	Audit SELinux label assignment.
	A more natural auditing point would perhaps be
	SELinuxSetSecurityProcessLabel, but this happens in the child after root
	permissions are dropped, so the kernel would refuse the audit record.

	Audit VM start/stop/suspend/resume
	Most operations are audited at the libvirtd level; auditing in
	src/libvirt.c would result in two audit entries per operation (one in
	the client, one in libvirtd).

	The only exception is a domain stopping of its own will (e.g. because
	the user clicks on "shutdown" inside the interface).  There can often be
	no client connected at the time the domain stops, so libvirtd does not
	have any virConnectPtr object on which to attach an event watch.  This
	patch therefore adds auditing directly inside the qemu driver (other
	drivers are not supported).

2010-10-20  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Basic framework for auditing integration
	Integrate with libaudit.so for auditing of important operations.
	libvirtd gains a couple of config entries for auditing. By
	default it will enable auditing, if its enabled on the host.
	It can be configured to force exit if auditing is disabled
	on the host. It will can also send audit messages via libvirt
	internal logging API

	Places requiring audit reporting can use the VIR_AUDIT
	macro to report data. This is a no-op unless auditing is
	enabled

	* autobuild.sh, mingw32-libvirt.spec.in: Disable audit
	  on mingw
	* configure.ac: Add check for libaudit
	* daemon/libvirtd.aug, daemon/libvirtd.conf,
	  daemon/test_libvirtd.aug, daemon/libvirtd.c: Add config
	  options to enable auditing
	* include/libvirt/virterror.h, src/util/virterror.c: Add
	  VIR_FROM_AUDIT source
	* libvirt.spec.in: Enable audit
	* src/util/virtaudit.h, src/util/virtaudit.c: Simple internal
	  API for auditing messages

	Fix statstest when driver modules are enabled
	The statstest is xen specific. Instead of filling the code with
	a huge number of #ifdef WITH_XEN, just make its entire compilation
	conditional in the Makefile.am. Also ensure it links to the Xen
	driver so that it builds when driver modules are enabled

	* tests/Makefile.am: Make statstest xen conditional. Link to
	  xen driver
	* tests/Makefile.am: Remove all conditionals

	vcpu: make old API trivially wrap to new API
	Note - this wrapping is completely mechanical; the old API will

	same flags are provided by the old API.  On a per-driver basis,
	it may make sense to have the old API pass a different set of flags,

	root_squash: virFileOperation may fail with EPERM too
	Over root-squashing nfs, when virFileOperation() is called as uid==0,

	qemudOpenAsUID is intended to open a file with the credentials of a

	qemu: let qemu group look below /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/
	Vdsm needs to communicate with its guest agent via unix domain socket,
	which qemu creates due to the following domain xml device:

	    <channel type='unix'>
	      <target type='virtio' name='com.redhat.rhevm.vdsm'/>
	      <source mode='bind' path='/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/channels/fcp-xp-1.com.redhat.rhevm.vdsm'/>
	    </channel>

	The location of the socket below /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/channels makes
	sense, to humans and selinux policy alike. However, that socket should
	be accessible to vdsm, too.

	Due to other (storage) reasons, vdsm is to join the "qemu" group. With
	this patch, vdsm can look below /var/lib/libvirt/qemu and connect to the
	socket.

	The socket itself should be chmod'ed to allow qemu group read/write, but
	that's for another project.

	  </rule>

	did previously not cut off existing (ssh) connections but only prevented newly initiated ones. The attached patch allows to cut off existing connections as well, thus enforcing what the filter is showing.

	I had only tested with a configuration where the physical interface is connected to the bridge where the filters are applied. This patch now also solves a filtering problem where the physical interface is not connected to the bridge, but the bridge is given an IP address and the host routes between bridge and physical interface. Here the filters drop non-allowed traffic on the outgoing side on the host.

	nwfilter: resolve deadlock between VM ops and filter update
	 This is from a bug report and conversation on IRC where Soren reported that while a filter update is occurring on one or more VMs (due to a rule having been edited for example), a deadlock can occur when a VM referencing a filter is started.

	The problem is caused by the two locking sequences of

	qemu driver, qemu domain, filter             # for the VM start operation
	filter, qemu_driver, qemu_domain            # for the filter update operation

	that obviously don't lock in the same order. The problem is the 2nd lock sequence. Here the qemu_driver lock is being grabbed in qemu_driver:qemudVMFilterRebuild()

	The following solution is based on the idea of trying to re-arrange the 2nd sequence of locks as follows:

	qemu_driver, filter, qemu_driver, qemu_domain

	and making the qemu driver recursively lockable so that a second lock can occur, this would then lead to the following net-locking sequence

	qemu_driver, filter, qemu_domain

	where the 2nd qemu_driver lock has been ( logically ) eliminated.

	The 2nd part of the idea is that the sequence of locks (filter, qemu_domain) and (qemu_domain, filter) becomes interchangeable if all code paths where filter AND qemu_domain are locked have a preceding qemu_domain lock that basically blocks their concurrent execution

	So, the following code paths exist towards qemu_driver:qemudVMFilterRebuild where we now want to put a qemu_driver lock in front of the filter lock.

	-> nwfilterUndefine()   [ locks the filter ]
	    -> virNWFilterTestUnassignDef()
	        -> virNWFilterTriggerVMFilterRebuild()
	            -> qemudVMFilterRebuild()

	-> nwfilterDefine()
	    -> virNWFilterPoolAssignDef() [ locks the filter ]
	        -> virNWFilterTriggerVMFilterRebuild()
	            -> qemudVMFilterRebuild()

	-> nwfilterDriverReload()
	    -> virNWFilterPoolLoadAllConfigs()
	        ->virNWFilterPoolObjLoad()
	            -> virNWFilterPoolAssignDef() [ locks the filter ]
	                -> virNWFilterTriggerVMFilterRebuild()
	                    -> qemudVMFilterRebuild()

	-> nwfilterDriverStartup()
	    -> virNWFilterPoolLoadAllConfigs()
	        ->virNWFilterPoolObjLoad()
	            -> virNWFilterPoolAssignDef() [ locks the filter ]
	                -> virNWFilterTriggerVMFilterRebuild()
	                    -> qemudVMFilterRebuild()

	Qemu is not the only driver using the nwfilter driver, but also the UML driver calls into it. Therefore qemuVMFilterRebuild() can be exchanged with umlVMFilterRebuild() along with the driver lock of qemu_driver that can now be a uml_driver. Further, since UML and Qemu domains can be running on the same machine, the triggering of a rebuild of the filter can touch both types of drivers and their domains.

	In the patch below I am now extending each nwfilter callback driver with functions for locking and unlocking the (VM) driver (UML, QEMU) and introduce new functions for locking all registered callback drivers and unlocking them. Then I am distributing the lock-all-cbdrivers/unlock-all-cbdrivers call into the above call paths. The last shown callpath starting with nwfilterDriverStart() is problematic since it is initialize before the Qemu and UML drives are and thus a lock in the path would result in a NULL pointer attempted to be locked -- the call to virNWFilterTriggerVMFilterRebuild() is never called, so we never lock either the qemu_driver or the uml_driver in that path. Therefore, only the first 3 paths now receive calls to lock and unlock all callback drivers. Now that the locks are distributed where it matters I can remove the qemu_driver and uml_driver lock from qemudVMFilterRebuild() and umlVMFilterRebuild() and not requiring the recursive locks.

	For now I want to put this out as an RFC patch. I have tested it by 'stretching' the critical section after the define/undefine functions each lock the filter so I can (easily) concurrently execute another VM operation (suspend,start). That code is in this patch and if you want you can de-activate it. It seems to work ok and operations are being blocked while the update is being done.
	I still also want to verify the other assumption above that locking filter and qemu_domain always has a preceding qemu_driver lock.

	virsh: rework command parsing
	Old virsh command parsing mashes all the args back into a string and
	miss the quotes, this patches fix it. It is also needed for introducing
	qemu-monitor-command which is very useful.

	This patches uses the new vshCommandParser abstraction and adds
	vshCommandArgvParse() for arguments vector, so we don't need
	to mash arguments vector into a command sting.

	And the usage was changed:
	old:
	virsh [options] [commands]

	new:
	virsh [options]... [<command_string>]
	virsh [options]... <command> [args...]

	So we still support commands like:
	"define D.xml; dumpxml D" was parsed as a commands-string.

	and support commands like:
	we will not mash them into a string, we use new argv parser for it.

	But we don't support the command like:
	"define D.xml; dumpxml" was parsed as a command-name, but we have no such command-name.

	virsh: add vshCommandParser abstraction
	add vshCommandParser and make vshCommandParse() accept different
	parsers.

	the current code for parse command string is integrated as
	vshCommandStringParse().

	virsh: better handling the boolean option
	in old code the following commands are equivalent:
	     virsh # dumpxml --update-cpu=vm1
	     virsh # dumpxml --update-cpu vm1
	because the old code split the option argument into 2 parts:
	--update-cpu=vm1 is split into update-cpu and vm1,
	and update-cpu is a boolean option, so the parser takes vm1 as another
	argument, very strange.

	after this patch applied, the first one will become illegal.

	To achieve this, we don't parse/check options when parsing command sting,
	but check options when parsing a command argument. And the argument is
	not split when parsing command sting.

	virsh: allow zero length arguments
	the following command is allowed at shell, we also make it allowed at virsh shell.

2010-10-13  Lai Jiangshan  <laijs@cn.fujitsu.com>

	virsh: better support double quote
	In origin code, double quote is only allowed at the begin or end
	"complicated argument"
	--some_opt="complicated string"  (we split this argument into 2 parts,
	option and data, the data is "complicated string").

	This patch makes it allow double quote at any position of
	an argument:
	complicated" argument"
	complicated" "argument
	--"some opt=complicated string"

	This patch is also needed for the following patches,
	the following patches will not split option argument into 2 parts,
	so we have to allow double quote at any position of an argument.

	xen: Fix virDomain{At,De}tachDevice
	According to API documentation virDomain{At,De}tachDevice calls are
	supposed to only work on active guests for device hotplug. For anything
	beyond that, their *Flags variants have to be used.

	Despite the variant which was acked on libvirt mailing list
	(https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2010-January/msg00385.html)
	commit ed9c14a7ef86d7a45a6d57cbfee5410fca428633 (by Jim Fehlig)
	introduced automagic behavior of these API calls for xen driver. Since
	January, these calls always change persistent configuration of a guest
	and if the guest is currently active, they also hot(un)plug the device.

	That change didn't follow API documentation and also broke device
	hot(un)plug for older xend implementations which do not support changing
	persistent configuration of a guest and hot(un)plugging in one step.

	This patch should not break anything for active guests. On the other

	capabilities. Both test cases will be used in TCK again.

	nwfilter: Instantiate state match in ip(6)tables rules
	In this patch I am extending the rule instantiator to create the state
	match according to the state attribute in the XML. Only one iptables
	rule in the incoming or outgoing direction will be created for a rule
	in direction 'in' or 'out' respectively. A rule in direction 'inout' does
	get iptables rules in both directions.

	virt-aa-helper-test cleanups
	Don't cat | sed, just sed.  Suggested by Eric Blake.

	implement usb and pci hot attach in AppArmor driver
	Description: Implement AppArmorSetSecurityHostdevLabel() and
	AppArmorRestoreSecurityHostdevLabel() for hostdev and pcidev attach.

	virt-aa-helper also has to be adjusted because *FileIterate() is used for pci
	and usb devices and the corresponding XML for hot attached hostdev and pcidev
	is not in the XML passed to virt-aa-helper. The new '-F filename' option is
	added to append a rule to the profile as opposed to the existing '-f
	filename', which rewrites the libvirt-<uuid>.files file anew. This new '-F'
	option will append a rule to an existing libvirt-<uuid>.files if it exists,
	otherwise it acts the same as '-f'.

	load_profile() and reload_profile() have been adjusted to add an 'append'
	argument, which when true will use '-F' instead of '-f' when executing
	virt-aa-helper.

	All existing calls to load_profile() and reload_profile() have been adjusted
	to use the old behavior (ie append==false) except AppArmorSetSavedStateLabel()
	where it made sense to use the new behavior.

	This patch also adds tests for '-F'.

	Since commands are written in the format

	certain characters ('`) in the comment need to be escaped to

	tests: silence qemuargv2xmltest noise

	.                        57  OK
	PASS: qemuargv2xmltest

	It's not a real failure (which is why the test was completing
	successfully), so much as an intentional warning to the user that use
	of the qemu namespace has the potential for undefined effects that
	leaked through the default logging behavior.  After this patch series,
	all tests can access any logged data, and this particular test can
	explicitly check for the presence or absence of the warning, such that
	the test output becomes:

	buf: Fix possible infinite loop in EscapeString, VSnprintf
	The current code will go into an infinite loop if the printf generated
	string is >= 1000, AND exactly 1 character smaller than the amount of free
	space in the buffer. When this happens, we are dropped into the loop body,
	but nothing will actually change, because count == (buf->size - buf->use - 1),
	and virBufferGrow returns unchanged if count < (buf->size - buf->use)

	Fix this by removing the '- 1' bit from 'size'. The *nprintf functions handle
	the NULL byte for us anyways, so we shouldn't need to manually accommodate
	for it.

	esx: Use SessionIsActive when available
	Before this commit SessionIsActive was not used because ESX(i)

	esx: Fall back to path as key when QueryVirtualDiskUuid isn't available
	QueryVirtualDiskUuid is only available on an ESX(i) server. vCenter
	returns an NotImplemented fault and a GSX server is missing the

	esx: Rework datastore path parsing and handling
	Instead of splitting the path part of a datastore path into
	directory and file name, keep this in one piece. An example:

	  "[datastore] directory/file"

	was split into this before:

	  datastoreName = "datastore"
	  directoryName = "directory"
	  fileName = "file"

	Now it's split into this:

	  datastoreName = "datastore"
	  directoryName = "directory"
	  directoryAndFileName = "directory/file"

	This simplifies code using esxUtil_ParseDatastorePath, because
	directoryAndFileName is used more often than fileName. Also the
	old approach expected the datastore path to reference an actual
	file, but this isn't always correct, especially when listing
	volumes. In that case esxUtil_ParseDatastorePath is used to parse
	a path that references a directory. This fails for a vpx://
	connection because the vCenter returns directory paths with a
	trailing '/'. The new approach is robust against this and the
	actual decision if the datastore path should reference a file or
	a directory is up to the caller of esxUtil_ParseDatastorePath.

	Update the tests accordingly.

	Use global directory as UML's monitorDir for privileged connections
	For privileged UML connections (uml:///system), we shouldn't use root's
	home dir, but rather somewhere in /var/run/libvirt/uml-guest.

	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=499536

	Explicitly pass uml_dir argument to user-mode-linux
	uml_dir overrides user-mode-linux's default of ~/.uml. This is needed
	for a couple of different reasons:

	libvirt expects this to default to virGetUserDirectory(geteuid()) +
	'/.uml'. However, user-mode-linux actually uses the HOME environment
	variable to determine where to look for the uml sockets, but if running
	libvirtd under sudo (which I routinely do during development), $HOME is
	pointing at my user's homedir, while my euid is 0, so libvirt looks in
	/root.

	Also (and this was my actual motivation for this patch), if HOME isn't
	set at all, user-mode-linux utterly fails. Looking at the code, it seems
	it's meant to emit a warning, but alas, it doesn't for some reason.
	If running libvirtd from upstart, HOME is not set, so any system using
	upstart will need this change.

	xen tests: Fix PV-VFB tests with RHEL-5 API
	RHEL-5 Xen doesn't support the old style vnc configuration. In sexpr, we
	can't really check it with rhel5-api turned on. However, for XM
	configuration files it's sufficient to use cfg version 1 instead of 2.

	xml2sexprtest: Remove graphics from unrelated tests
	This caused unnecessary make check failures when libvirt is configured
	--with-rhel5-api

	xen tests: Fix missing "type ioemu" with rhel5-api
	The most common cause of errors with rhel5-api turn on was missing
	"(type ioemu)" in sexpr or its equivalent in XM configuration file. This
	happens because the presence of that part in sexpr (or cfg) depends on
	xen version the host is running. Let's avoid it by explicitly specifying
	interface model which ensures "type ioemu" will always be emitted.

	This patch adds

	    <model type='e1000'/>

	withing the interface element in all affected xml files. And

	    (model 'e1000')

	to all corresponding sexpr files with similar fix to cfg files. Such

	nwfilter: extend nwfilter reload support
	In this patch I am extending and fixing the nwfilter module's reload support to stop all ongoing threads (for learning IP addresses of interfaces) and rebuild the filtering rules of all interfaces of all VMs when libvirt is started. Now libvirtd rebuilds the filters upon the SIGHUP signal and libvirtd restart.

	About the patch: The nwfilter functions require a virConnectPtr. Therefore I am opening a connection in qemudStartup, which later on needs to be closed outside where the driver lock is held since otherwise it ends up in a deadlock due to virConnectClose() trying to lock the driver as well.

	I have tested this now for a while with several machines running and needing the IP address learner thread(s). The rebuilding of the firewall rules seems to work fine following libvirtd restart or a SIGHUP. Also the termination of libvirtd worked fine.

	Make umlConnectTapDevice ask brAddTap for a persistent tap device.
	This patch does two things:

	 * It makes umlConnectTapDevice ask brAddTap for a persistent tap by
	   passing it a NULL tapfd argument.
	 * Stops umlConnectTapDevice from immediately dismantling the bridge
	   it just set up.

	Close fd's of persistent tap devices
	When passing a NULL tapfd argument to brAddTap, we need to close the fd
	of the tap device. If we don't, libvirt will keep the fd open
	indefinitely and renders the the guest unable to configure its side of
	the tap device.

	Make sure all command line arguments get passed to UML
	If umlBuildCommandLineChr fails (e.g. due to an unsupported chardev
	type), it returns NULL. umlBuildCommandLine does not check for this and
	sets this as an argument on the comand line, effectively ending the
	argument list. This patch checks for this case and sets the chardev to
	"none".

	nwfilter: Discard class D,E IP addresses when sniffing pkts
	When sniffing the network traffic, discard class D and E IP addresses when sniffing traffic. This was a reason why filters were not correctly rebuilt on VMs on the local 192.* network when libvirt was restarted and those VMs did not use a DHCP request to get its IP address.

	nwfilter: serialize execution of scripts with ebtables cmds
	While testing the SIGHUP handling and reloading of the nwfilter driver, I found that when the filters are rebuilt and mutlipe threads handled the individual interfaces, concurrently running multiple external bash scripts causes strange failures even though the executed ebtables commands are working on different tables for different interfaces. I cannot say for sure where the concurrency problems are caused, but introducing this lock definitely helps.

	look at the unix socket in /var/run/libvirt/qemu which is owned by
	root and has permission 700.  Move the unix socket to
	/var/lib/libvirt/qemu, which is already owned by qemu:qemu.

	Thanks to Justin Clift for test this out for me.

	Fix tunnelled migration with qemu running as qemu:qemu.
	The problem is that on the source of the migration, libvirtd
	is responsible for creating the unix socket over which the data
	will flow.  Since libvirtd is running as root, this file will
	be created as root.  When the qemu process running as qemu:qemu
	goes to access the unix file to write data to it, it will get
	permission denied and fail.  Make sure to change the owner
	of the unix file to qemu:qemu.

	bridge: Add --dhcp-no-override option to dnsmasq
	--dhcp-no-override description from dnsmasq man page:

	      Disable  re-use  of  the  DHCP servername and filename fields as
	      extra option space. If it can, dnsmasq moves the boot server and
	      filename  information  (from  dhcp-boot)  out of their dedicated
	      fields into DHCP options. This make extra space available in the
	      DHCP  packet  for options but can, rarely, confuse old or broken
	      clients. This flag forces "simple and safe" behaviour  to  avoid
	      problems in such a case.

	It seems some virtual network card ROMs are this old/buggy so let's add
	--dhcp-no-override as a workaround for them. We don't use extra DHCP
	options so this should be safe. The option was added in dnsmasq-2.41,
	which becomes the minimum required version.

	qemu: Hack around asynchronous device_del
	device_del command is not synchronous for PCI devices, it merely asks
	the guest to release the device and returns. If the host wants to use
	that device before the guest actually releases it, we are in big
	trouble. To avoid this, we already added a loop which waits up to 10
	seconds until the device is actually released before we do anything else
	with that device. But we only added this loop for managed PCI devices
	before we try reattach them back to the host.

	However, we need to wait even for non-managed devices. We don't reattach
	them automatically, but we still want to prevent the host from using it.
	This was revealed thanks to sVirt: when we relabel sysfs files
	corresponding to the PCI device before the guest finished releasing the
	device, qemu is no longer allowed to access those files and if it wants
	(as a result of guest's request) to write anything to them, it just
	exits, which kills the guest.

	This is not a proper fix and needs some further work both on libvirt and
	qemu side in the future.

	src/phyp/phyp_driver.c:phypListDomainsGeneric was crashing due to a buffer
	overflow if any line returned from virRun wasn't <=10 characters.

	Since virStrToLong_i recognizes any non-numeric as a terminator (not

	separate string anyway, so this patch eliminates that copy, the fixed
	length buffer, and therefore the potential to overflow.

	This change also provided the oppurtunity to eliminate the character

	past the end of the number, then simply skip the \n to get to the

	qemu: Fix PCI address allocation
	Patch version revamped by Eric Blake <eblake@redhat.com> of Jiri
	Denemark <jdenemar@redhat.com> original patch

	When attaching a PCI device which doesn't explicitly set its PCI
	address, libvirt allocates the address automatically. The problem is
	that when checking which PCI address is unused, we only check for those
	with slot number higher than the highest slot number ever used.

	Thus attaching/detaching such device several times in a row (31 is the
	theoretical limit, less then 30 tries are enough in practise) makes any
	further device attachment fail. Furthermore, attaching a device with
	predefined PCI address to 0:0:31 immediately forbids attachment of any
	PCI device without explicit address.

	This patch changes the logic so that we always check all PCI addresses
	before we say there is no PCI address available.

	Modifications from v1: revert back to remembering the last slot
	reserved, but allow wraparound to not be limited by the end.
	In this way, slots are still assigned in the same order as
	before the patch, rather than filling in the gaps closest to
	0 and risking making windows guests mad.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: fix pci reservation code to do a round-robbin
	  check of all available PCI splot availability before failing.

	Ensure that migration source and destination refer to the
	same vCenter. Also directly encode the resource pool and

	Add iptables rule to fixup DHCP response checksum.
	This patch attempts to take advantage of a newly added netfilter
	module to correct for a problem with some guest DHCP client
	implementations when used in conjunction with a DHCP server run on the
	host systems with packet checksum offloading enabled.

	The problem is that, when the guest uses a RAW socket to read the DHCP
	response packets, the checksum hasn't yet been fixed by the IP stack,
	so it is incorrect.

	The fix implemented here is to add a rule to the POSTROUTING chain of
	the mangle table in iptables that fixes up the checksum for packets on
	the virtual network's bridge that are destined for the bootpc port (ie
	"dhcpc", ie port 68) port on the guest.

	Only very new versions of iptables will have this support (it will be
	in the next upstream release), so a failure to add this rule only
	results in a warning message. The iptables patch is here:

	  http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/58525/

	A corresponding kernel module patch is also required (the backend of
	the iptables patch) and that will be in the next release of the
	kernel.

2010-08-02  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Fix the ACS checking in the PCI code.
	When trying to assign a PCI device to a guest, we have
	to check that all bridges upstream of that device support
	ACS.  That means that we have to find the parent bridge of
	the current device, check for ACS, then find the parent bridge
	of that device, check for ACS, etc.  As it currently stands,
	the code to do this iterates through all PCI devices on the
	system, looking for a device that has a range of busses that
	included the current device's bus.

	That check is not restrictive enough, though.  Depending on
	how we iterated through the list of PCI devices, we could first
	find the *topmost* bridge in the system; since it necessarily had
	a range of busses including the current device's bus, we
	would only ever check the topmost bridge, and not check
	any of the intermediate bridges.

	Note that this also caused a fairly serious bug in the
	secondary bus reset code, where we could erroneously
	find and reset the topmost bus instead of the inner bus.

	This patch changes pciGetParentDevice() so that it first
	checks if a bridge device's secondary bus exactly matches
	the bus of the device we are looking for.  If it does, we've
	found the correct parent bridge and we are done.  If it does not,
	then we check to see if this bridge device's busses *include* the
	bus of the device we care about.  If so, we mark this bridge device
	as best, and go on.  If we later find another bridge device whose
	busses include this device, but is more restrictive, then we
	free up the previous best and mark the new one as best.  This
	algorithm ensures that in the normal case we find the direct
	parent, but in the case that the parent bridge secondary bus
	is not exactly the same as the device, we still find the
	correct bridge.

	This patch was tested by me on a 4-port NIC with a
	bridge without ACS (where assignment failed), a 4-port
	NIC with a bridge with ACS (where assignment succeeded),
	and a 2-port NIC with no bridges (where assignment
	succeeded).

	Free up memballoon def.
	Forgetting to do this was causing a memory leak.

	Don't put a semicolon on the end of a VIR_ENUM_IMPL.

	Fix a bogus warning when parsing <hostdev>
	When parsing hostdev, the following message would be emitted:

	10:17:19.052: error : virDomainHostdevDefParseXML:3748 : internal error unknown node alias

	However, alias is appropriately parsed in
	virDomainDeviceInfoParseXML anyway.  Disable the error message
	in the initial XML parsing loop.

	esx: Switch from name to number checks in the subdrivers

	esx: Improve blocked task detection and fix race condition
	esxVI_WaitForTaskCompletion can take a UUID to lookup the
	corresponding domain and check if the current task for it
	is blocked by a question. It calls another function to do
	this: esxVI_LookupAndHandleVirtualMachineQuestion looks up
	the VirtualMachine and checks for a question. If there is
	a question it calls esxVI_HandleVirtualMachineQuestion to
	handle it.

	If there was no question or it has been answered the call
	to esxVI_LookupAndHandleVirtualMachineQuestion returns 0.
	If any error occurred during the lookup and answering
	process -1 is returned. The problem with this is, that -1
	is also returned when there was no error but the question
	could not be answered. So esxVI_WaitForTaskCompletion cannot
	distinguish between this two situations and reports that a
	question is blocking the task even when there was actually
	another problem.

	This inherent problem didn't surface until vSphere 4.1 when
	you try to define a new domain. The driver tries to lookup
	the domain that is just in the process of being registered.
	There seems to be some kind of race condition and the driver
	manages to issue a lookup command before the ESX server was
	able to register the domain. This used to work before.

	Due to the return value problem described above the driver
	reported a false error message in that case.

	To solve this esxVI_WaitForTaskCompletion now takes an
	additional occurrence parameter that describes whether or
	not to expect the domain to be existent. Also add a new
	parameter to esxVI_LookupAndHandleVirtualMachineQuestion
	that allows to distinguish if the call returned -1 because
	of an actual error or because the question could not be
	answered.

	lxc: Fix return values of veth.c functions
	Previously, the functions in src/lxc/veth.c could sometimes return
	positive values on failure rather than -1. This made accurate error
	reporting difficult, and led to one failure to catch an error in a
	calling function.

	This patch makes all the functions in veth.c consistently return 0 on
	success, and -1 on failure. It also fixes up the callers to the veth.c
	functions where necessary.

	Note that this patch may be related to the bug:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=607496.

	It will not fix the bug, but should unveil what happens.

	* po/POTFILES.in - add veth.c, which previously had no translatable strings
	* src/lxc/lxc_controller.c
	* src/lxc/lxc_container.c
	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c    - fixup callers to veth.c, and remove error logs,
	                            as they are now done in veth.c
	* src/lxc/veth.c - make all functions consistently return -1 on error.
	* src/lxc/veth.h - use ATTRIBUTE_NONNULL to protect against NULL args.

	Fix a potential race in pciInitDevice.
	If detecting the FLR flag of a pci device fails, then we
	could run into the situation of trying to close a file
	descriptor twice, once in pciInitDevice() and once in pciFreeDevice().
	Fix that by removing the pciCloseConfig() in pciInitDevice() and
	just letting pciFreeDevice() handle it.

	Thanks to Chris Wright for pointing out this problem.

	While we are at it, fix an error check.  While it would actually
	work as-is (since success returns 0), it's still more clear to
	check for < 0 (as the rest of the code does).

	qemu: virtio console support
	Enable specifying a virtio console device with:

	<console type='pty'>
	  <target type='virtio'/>
	</console>

	domain conf: Track <console> target type
	All <console> devices now export a <target> type attribute. QEMU defaults
	to 'serial', UML defaults to 'uml, xen can be either 'serial' or 'xen'
	depending on fullvirt. Understandably there is lots of test fallout.

	This will be used to differentiate between a serial vs. virtio console for
	QEMU.

	domain conf: char: Add an explicit targetType field
	targetType only tracks the actual <target> format we are parsing. Currently
	we only fill abide this value for channel devices.

	domain conf: Rename character prop targetType -> deviceType
	There is actually a difference between the character device type (serial,
	parallel, channel, ...) and the target type (virtio, guestfwd). Currently
	they are awkwardly conflated.

	Start to pull them apart by renaming targetType -> deviceType. This is
	an entirely mechanical change.

	maint: turn on gcc logical-op checking
	This would have detected the bug in commit 38ad33931 (Aug 09), which
	we missed until commit f828ca35 (Jul 10); over 11 months later.

	However, on Fedora 13, it also triggers LOTS of warnings from
	the libcurl-devel header for two files:

	esx/esx_vi.c: In function 'esxVI_CURL_Perform':
	esx/esx_vi.c:232: error: logical '&&' with non-zero constant will always evaluate as true [-Wlogical-op]

	xenapi/xenapi_driver.c:1872: error: logical '&&' with non-zero constant will always evaluate as true [-Wlogical-op]
	...

	libcurl allows to disable the type-checking code that triggers those
	warnings, along with the reduction in type-safety of calls to some
	libcurl functions. I figure this is worth the improved compiler
	checking throughout the rest of libvirt.

	* acinclude.m4 (--enable-compile-warnings=error): Add -Wlogical-op.
	* configure.ac: Add -DCURL_DISABLE_TYPECHECK to LIBCURL_CFLAGS to

	Invert logic for checking for QEMU disk cache options
	QEMU has had two different syntax for disk cache options

	 Old: on|off
	 New: writeback|writethrough|none

	QEMU recently added another 'unsafe' option which broke the
	libvirt check. We can avoid this & future breakage, if we
	do a negative check for the old syntax, instead of a positive
	check for the new syntax

	qemu: Allow setting boot menu on/off
	Add a new element to the <os> block:

	  <bootmenu enable="yes|no"/>

	Which maps to -boot,menu=on|off on the QEMU command line.

	I decided to use an explicit 'enable' attribute rather than just make the
	bootmenu element boolean. This allows us to treat lack of a bootmenu element
	as 'use hypervisor default'.

	pciResetDevice: use inactive devices to determine safe reset
	When doing a PCI secondary bus reset, we must be sure that there are no
	active devices on the same bus segment.  The active device tracking is
	designed to only track host devices that are active in use by guests.
	This ignores host devices that are actively in use by the host.  So the
	current logic will reset host devices.

	Switch this logic around and allow sbus reset when we are assigning all
	devices behind a bridge to the same guest at guest startup or as a result
	of a single attach-device command.

	* src/util/pci.h: change signature of pciResetDevice to add an
	  inactive devices list
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c src/xen/xen_driver.c: use (or not) the new
	  functionality of pciResetDevice() depending on the place of use
	* src/util/pci.c: implement the interface and logic changes

	qemudDomainAttachHostPciDevice refactor to use new helpers
	- src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Eliminate code duplication by using the new
	  helpers qemuPrepareHostdevPCIDevices and qemuDomainReAttachHostdevDevices.
	  This reduces the number of open coded calls to pciResetDevice.

	Add helpers qemuPrepareHostdevPCIDevice and qemuDomainReAttachHostdevDevices
	- src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: These new helpers take hostdev list and count
	  directly rather than getting them indirectly from domain definition.
	  This will allow reuse for the attach-device case.

	qemuGetPciHostDeviceList take hostdev list directly
	- src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Update qemuGetPciHostDeviceList to take a
	  hostdev list and count directly, rather than getting this indirectly
	  from domain definition. This will allow reuse for the attach-device case.

	esx: Support vSphere 4.1
	Also accept version > 4.1, but output a warning.

	esx: Add vpx:// scheme to allow direct connection to a vCenter
	Add a pointer to the primary context of a connection and use it in all
	driver functions that don't dependent on the context type. This includes
	almost all functions that deal with a virDomianPtr. Therefore, using
	a vpx:// connection allows you to perform all the usual domain related
	actions like start, destroy, suspend, resume, dumpxml etc.

	Some functions that require an explicitly specified ESX server don't work
	yet. This includes the host UUID, the hostname, the general node info, the
	max vCPU count and the free memory. Also not working yet are migration and
	defining new domains.

	Since 070f61002f47b602c15d1e4950a122ac9edefe1b the vcenter query
	parameter has been ignored, because the refactoring to use
	esxUtil_ParseQuery was incomplete. This effectively broke migration,
	because the vcenter query parameter is essential for a migration.

	secaatest: Fix compilation
	Since 68719c4bddb85fbcc931a5b7d99ac7c8a0af09b0 virSecurityDriverStartup
	takes and additional parameter to control disk format probing.

	Pass false as third parameter.

	virt-aa-helper-test: Fix failure due to the new disk format probing option
	Commit 68719c4bddb85fbcc931a5b7d99ac7c8a0af09b0 added the disk format
	probing option. This makes virt-aa-helper-test fail because the domain
	config didn't specifiy the disk format and it didn't pass '-p 1' to
	virt-aa-helper to allow disk format probing.

	Specify the disk format in the domain config. Pass the '-p 1' option
	to virt-aa-helper for the test case with two disks. This way this test
	also covers this new option.

	virt-aa-helper: Make getopt accept the p option
	Commit 68719c4bddb85fbcc931a5b7d99ac7c8a0af09b0 added the
	p option to control disk format probing, but it wasn't added
	to the getopt_long optstring parameter.

	Add the p option to the getopt_long optstring parameter.

	virt-aa-helper: Fix return value of add_file_path
	Commit a8853344994a7c6aaca882a5e949ab5536821ab5 added this
	function and wrapped vah_add_file in it. vah_add_file may
	return -1, 0, 1. It returns 1 in case the call to valid_path
	detects a restricted file. The original code treated a return
	value != 0 as error. The refactored code treats a return
	value < 0 as error. This triggers segfault in virt-aa-helper
	and breaks virt-aa-helper-test for the restricted file tests.

	Make sure that add_file_path returns -1 on error.

	virt-aa-helper: Ignore open errors again
	virt-aa-helper used to ignore errors when opening files.
	Commit a8853344994a7c6aaca882a5e949ab5536821ab5 refactored
	the related code and changed this behavior. virt-aa-helper
	didn't ignore open errors anymore and virt-aa-helper-test
	fails.

	qemu-api: avoid build failure
	* src/remote_protocol-structs: Tweak to match intentional type
	change (with no ABI change) in remote protocol.

2010-07-24  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Add tests for the new Qemu namespace XML.
	Thanks to DV for knocking together the Relax-NG changes
	quickly for me.

	Changes since v1:
	 - Change the domain.rng to correspond to the new schema
	 - Don't allocate caps->ns in testQemuCapsInit since it is a static table

	Changes since v2:
	 - Change domain.rng to add restrictions on allowed environment names

	Changes since v3:
	 - Remove a bogus comment in the tests

	Qemu remote protocol.
	Since we are adding a new "per-hypervisor" protocol, we
	make it so that the qemu remote protocol uses a new
	PROTOCOL and PROGRAM number.  This allows us to easily
	distinguish it from the normal REMOTE protocol.

	This necessitates changing the proc in remote_message_header
	from a "remote_procedure" to an "unsigned", which should
	be the same size (and thus preserve the on-wire protocol).

	Changes since v1:
	 - Fixed up a couple of script problems in remote_generate_stubs.pl
	 - Switch an int flag to a bool in dispatch.c

	Changes since v2:
	 - None

	Changes since v3:
	 - Change unsigned proc to signed proc, to conform to spec

	Qemu arbitrary monitor commands.
	Implement the qemu driver's virDomainQemuMonitorCommand
	and hook it into the API entry point.

	Changes since v1:
	 - Rename the (external) qemuMonitorCommand to qemuDomainMonitorCommand
	 - Add virCheckFlags to qemuDomainMonitorCommand

	Changes since v2:
	 - Drop ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED from the flags

	Changes since v3:
	 - Add a flag to priv so we only print out monitor command warning once.  Note
	   that this has not been plumbed into qemuDomainObjPrivateXMLFormat or
	   qemuDomainObjPrivateXMLParse, which means that if you run a monitor command,
	   restart libvirtd, and then run another monitor command, you may get an
	   an erroneous VIR_INFO.  It's a pretty minor matter, and I didn't think it
	   warranted the additional code.
	 - Add BeginJob/EndJob calls around EnterMonitor/ExitMonitor

	Qemu Monitor API entry point.
	Add the library entry point for the new virDomainQemuMonitorCommand()
	entry point.  Because this is not part of the "normal" libvirt API,
	it gets its own header file, library file, and will eventually
	get its own over-the-wire protocol later in the series.

	Changes since v1:
	 - Go back to using the virDriver table for qemuDomainMonitorCommand, due to
	   linking issues
	 - Added versioning information to the libvirt-qemu.so

	Changes since v2:
	 - None

	Changes since v3:
	 - Add LGPL header to libvirt-qemu.c
	 - Make virLibConnError and virLibDomainError macros instead of function calls

	Changes since v4:
	 - Move exported symbols to libvirt_qemu.syms

	Handle arbitrary qemu command-lines in qemuParseCommandLine.
	Now that we have the ability to specify arbitrary qemu
	command-line parameters in the XML, use it to handle unknown
	command-line parameters when doing a native-to-xml conversion.

	Changes since v1:
	 - Rename num_extra to num_args
	 - Fix up a memory leak on an error path

	Changes since v2:
	 - Add a VIR_WARN when adding the argument via qemu:arg

	Changes since v3:
	 - None

	Qemu arbitrary command-line arguments.
	Implement the qemu hooks for XML namespace data.  This
	allows us to specify a qemu XML namespace, and then
	specify:

	<qemu:commandline>
	 <qemu:arg value='arg'/>
	 <qemu:env name='name' value='value'/>
	</qemu:commandline>

	In the domain XML.

	Changes since v1:
	 - Change the <qemu:arg>arg</qemu:arg> XML to <qemu:arg value='arg'/> XML
	 - Fix up some memory leaks in qemuDomainDefNamespaceParse
	 - Rename num_extra and extra to num_args and args, respectively
	 - Fixed up some error messages
	 - Make sure to escape user-provided data in qemuDomainDefNamespaceFormatXML

	Changes since v2:
	 - Add checking to ensure environment variable names are valid
	 - Invert the logic in qemuDomainDefNamespaceFormatXML to return early

	Changes since v3:
	 - Change strspn() to c_isalpha() check of first letter of environment variable

	Add namespace callback hooks to domain_conf.
	This patch adds namespace XML parsers to be hooked into
	the main domain parser.  This allows for individual hypervisor
	drivers to add per-namespace XML into the main domain XML.

	Changes since v1:
	 - Use a statically declared table for caps->ns, removing the need to
	   allocate/free it.

	Changes since v2:
	 - None

	Changes since v3:
	 - None

	Fix SEGV on exit after domainEventDeregister()
	When the last callback is removed using domainEventDeregister(), the
	events dispatcher is deregistered from the C-library, but
	domainEventsCallbacks is still an empty list.
	On shutdown __del__() deregisters the dispatacher again, which SEGVs

		# You need the event-loop implementation from the Python examples;
		# give the file a name which is importable by Python.
		ln examples/domain-events/events-python/event-test.py eloop.py
		python -c 'from eloop import *
		import sys

		def dump(*args): print " ".join(map(str, args))

		virEventLoopPureStart()
		c = libvirt.open("xen:///")
		c.domainEventRegister(dump, None)
		c.domainEventDeregister(dump)
		sys.exit(0)'

	domainEventDeregister() needs to delete domainEventCallbacks so subsequent
	calls to __del__() and domainEventRegister() choose the right code paths.
	Setting it to None is not enough, since calling domainEventRegiser() again
	would trigger an TypeError.

	pciSharesBusWithActive fails to find multiple devices on bus
	The first conditional is always true which means the iterator will
	never find another device on the same bus.

	    if (dev->domain != check->domain ||
	        dev->bus != check->bus ||
	  ----> (check->slot == check->slot &&
	         check->function == check->function)) <-----

	The goal of that check is to verify that the device is either:

	  in a different pci domain
	  on a different bus
	  is the same identical device

	This means libvirt may issue a secondary bus reset when there are
	devices
	on that bus that actively in use by the host or another guest.

	Fix incorrect use of private data in remote driver
	The remote driver is using the wrong privateData field in

	* src/remote/remote_driver.c: Fix use of privateData field

	Set a stable & high MAC addr for guest TAP devices on host
	A Linux software bridge will assume the MAC address of the enslaved
	interface with the numerically lowest MAC addr. When the bridge
	changes MAC address there is a period of network blackout, so a
	change should be avoided. The kernel gives TAP devices a completely
	random MAC address. Occassionally the random TAP device MAC is lower
	than that of the physical interface (eth0, eth1etc) that is enslaved,
	causing the bridge to change its MAC.

	This change sets an explicit MAC address for all TAP devices created
	using the configured MAC from the XML, but with the high byte set
	to 0xFE. This should ensure TAP device MACs are higher than any
	physical interface MAC.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/uml/uml_conf.c: Pass in a MAC addr
	  for the TAP device with high byte set to 0xFE
	* src/util/bridge.c, src/util/bridge.h: Set a MAC when creating
	  the TAP device to override random MAC

	Fix PCI address assignment if no IDE controller is present
	The PCI slot 1 must be reserved at all times, since PIIX3 is
	always present, even if no IDE device is in use for guest disks

	Remove erroneous setting of return value to errno.
	One error exit in virStorageBackendCreateBlockFrom was setting the
	return value to errno. The convention for volume build functions is to
	return 0 on success or -1 on failure. Not only was it not necessary to
	set the return value (it defaults to -1, and is set to 0 when
	everything has been successfully completed), in the case that some
	caller were checking for < 0 rather than != 0, they would incorrectly
	believe that it completed successfully.

	Change virDirCreate to return -errno on failure.
	virDirCreate also previously returned 0 on success and errno on
	failure. This makes it fit the recommended convention of returning 0
	on success, -errno (ie a negative number) on failure.

	Make virStorageBackendCopyToFD return -errno.
	Previously virStorageBackendCopyToFD would simply return -1 on
	error. This made the error return from one of its callers inconsistent
	(createRawFileOpHook is supposed to return -errno, but if
	virStorageBackendCopyToFD failed, createRawFileOpHook would just
	return -1). Since there is a useful errno in every case of error
	return from virStorageBackendCopyToFD, and since the other uses of
	that function ignore the return code (beyond simply checking to see if
	it is < 0), this is a safe change.

	Change virFileOperation to return -errno (ie < 0) on error.
	virFileOperation previously returned 0 on success, or the value of
	errno on failure. Although there are other functions in libvirt that
	use this convention, the preferred (and more common) convention is to
	return 0 on success and -errno (or simply -1 in some cases) on
	failure. This way the check for failure is always (ret < 0).

	* src/util/util.c - change virFileOperation and virFileOperationNoFork to
	                    return -errno on failure.

	* src/storage/storage_backend.c, src/qemu/qemu_driver.c
	  - change the hook functions passed to virFileOperation to return
	    -errno on failure.

	* formatdomain.html.in: Document <memballoon> element

	Re-arrange PCI device address assignment to match QEMU's default
	To try and ensure that people upgrading from old QEMU get guests
	with the same PCI device ordering, change the way we assign addrs
	to match QEMU's default order. This should make Windows less
	annoyed.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Follow QEMU's default PCI ordering

2010-07-21  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Explicitly represent balloon device in XML and handle PCI address
	To allow compatibility with older QEMU PCI device slot assignment
	it is necessary to explicitly track the balloon device in the
	XML. This introduces a new device

	   <memballoon model='virtio|xen'/>

	It can also have a PCI address, auto-assigned if necessary.

	The memballoon will be automatically added to all Xen and QEMU
	guests by default.

	* docs/schemas/domain.rng: Add <memballoon> element
	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h: parsing
	  and formatting for memballoon device. Always add a memory
	  balloon device to Xen/QEMU if none exists in XML
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Export memballoon model APIs
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Honour the
	  PCI device address in memory balloon device
	* tests/*: Update to test new functionality

	Rearrange VGA/IDE controller address reservation
	The first VGA and IDE devices need to have fixed PCI address
	reservations. Currently this is handled inline with the other
	non-primary VGA/IDE devices. The fixed virtio balloon device
	at slot 3, ensures auto-assignment skips the slots 1/2. The
	virtio address will shortly become configurable though. This
	means the reservation of fixed slots needs to be done upfront
	to ensure that they don't get re-used for other devices.

	This is more or less reverting the previous changeset:

	  commit 83acdeaf173b2a1206b755c1ab317cac36facd90
	  Author: Daniel P. Berrange <berrange@redhat.com>
	  Date:   Wed Feb 3 16:11:29 2010 +0000

	  Fix restore of QEMU guests with PCI device reservation

	The difference is that this time, instead of unconditionally
	reserving the address, we only reserve the address if it was
	initially type=none. Addresses of type=pci were handled
	earlier in process by qemuDomainPCIAddressSetCreate(). This
	ensures restore step doesn't have problems

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Reserve first VGA + IDE address
	  upfront

	Remove inappropriate use of VIR_ERR_NO_SUPPORT
	The VIR_ERR_NO_SUPPORT refers to an API which is not implemented.
	There is a separate VIR_ERR_CONFIG_UNSUPPORTED for XML config
	options that are not available with the current hypervisor.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Remove
	  many VIR_ERR_NO_SUPPORT replace with VIR_ERR_CONFIG_UNSUPPORTED

	Fix a deadlock in bi-directional p2p concurrent migration.
	If you try to execute two concurrent migrations p2p
	from A->B and B->A, the two libvirtd's will deadlock
	trying to perform the migrations.  The reason for this is
	that in p2p migration, the libvirtd's are responsible for
	making the RPC Prepare, Migrate, and Finish calls.  However,
	they are currently holding the driver lock while doing so,
	which basically guarantees deadlock in this scenario.

	This patch fixes the situation by adding
	qemuDomainObjEnterRemoteWithDriver and
	qemuDomainObjExitRemoteWithDriver helper methods.  The Enter
	take an additional object reference, then drops both the
	domain object lock and the driver lock.  The Exit takes
	both the driver and domain object lock, then drops the
	reference.  Adding calls to these Enter and Exit helpers
	around remote calls in the various migration methods
	seems to fix the problem for me in testing.

	This should make the situation safe. The additional domain
	object reference ensures that the domain object won't disappear
	while this operation is happening.  The BeginJob that is called
	inside of qemudDomainMigratePerform ensures that we can't execute a
	second migrate (or shutdown, or save, etc) job while the
	migration is active.  Finally, the additional check on the state
	of the vm after we reacquire the locks ensures that we can't
	be surprised by an external event (domain crash, etc).

	Make virsh setmaxmem balloon only when successful.
	After playing around with virsh setmaxmem for a bit,
	I ran into some surprising behavior; if a hypervisor does
	not support the virDomainSetMaxMemory() API, but the value
	specified for setmaxmem is less than the current amount
	of memory in the domain, the domain would be ballooned
	down *before* an error was reported.

	To make this more consistent, run virDomainSetMaxMemory()
	before trying to shrink; that way, if an error is thrown,
	no changes to the running domain are made.

	Use unsigned long in cmdSetmem.
	The virsh command "setmem" takes as input a number that
	should represent an unsigned long number of kilobytes.  Fix
	cmdSetmem to properly parse this as an unsigned long instead
	of an int.

	fsync new storage volumes even if new volume was copied.
	Originally the storage volume files were opened with O_DSYNC to make
	sure they were flushed to disk immediately. It turned out that this
	was extremely slow in some cases, so the O_DSYNC was removed in favor
	of just calling fsync() after all the data had been written. However,
	this call to fsync was inside the block that is executed to zero-fill
	the end of the volume file. In cases where the new volume is copied
	from an old volume, and they are the same length, this fsync would
	never take place.

	Now the fsync is *always* done, unless there is an error (in which
	case it isn't important, and is most likely inappropriate.

	Don't skip zero'ing end of volume file when inputvol is shorter than newvol
	A missing set of braces around an error condition caused us to skip
	zero'ing out the remainder of a new volume file if the new volume was
	longer than the original (the goto was supposed to be taken only in
	the case of error, but was always being taken).

	Always clear out the last_error in virshReportError.
	Otherwise you can get bogus "unknown error" printouts on
	subsequent commands.

	Fix up inconsistent virsh option error reporting.
	The virsh option error reporting was not being used
	consistently; some commands would spit out errors on
	missing required options while others would just silently fail.
	However, vshCommandOptString knows which ones are required
	and which ones aren't, so make it spit out an error where
	appropriate.  The rest of the patch is just cleaning up
	the uses of vshCommandOptString to deal with the new error
	reporting.

	Use the extract backing store format in storage volume lookup
	The storage volume lookup code was probing for the backing store
	format, instead of using the format extracted from the file
	itself. This meant it could report in accurate information. If
	a format is included in the file, then use that in preference,
	with probing as a fallback.

	* src/storage/storage_backend_fs.c: Use extracted backing store
	  format

	Rewrite qemu-img backing store format handling
	When creating qcow2 files with a backing store, it is important
	to set an explicit format to prevent QEMU probing. The storage
	backend was only doing this if it found a 'kvm-img' binary. This
	is wrong because plenty of kvm-img binaries don't support an
	explicit format, and plenty of 'qemu-img' binaries do support
	a format. The result was that most qcow2 files were not getting
	a backing store format.

	This patch runs 'qemu-img -h' to check for the two support
	argument formats

	  '-o backing_format=raw'
	  '-F raw'

	and use whichever option it finds

	* src/storage/storage_backend.c: Query binary to determine
	  how to set the backing store format

	Add ability to set a default driver name/type when parsing disks
	Record a default driver name/type in capabilities struct. Use this
	when parsing disks if value is not set in XML config.

	* src/conf/capabilities.h: Record default driver name/type for disks
	* src/conf/domain_conf.c: Fallback to default driver name/type
	  when parsing disks
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Set default driver name/type to raw

	Disable all disk probing in QEMU driver & add config option to re-enable
	Disk format probing is now disabled by default. A new config
	option in /etc/qemu/qemu.conf will re-enable it for existing
	deployments where this causes trouble

	Pass security driver object into all security driver callbacks
	The implementation of security driver callbacks often needs
	to access the security driver object. Currently only a handful
	of callbacks include the driver object as a parameter. Later
	patches require this is many more places.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Pass in the security driver object
	  to all callbacks

	  src/security/security_apparmor.c, src/security/security_driver.h,
	  src/security/security_selinux.c: Add a virSecurityDriverPtr
	  param to all security callbacks

	Convert all disk backing store loops to shared helper API
	Update the QEMU cgroups code, QEMU DAC security driver, SELinux
	and AppArmour security drivers over to use the shared helper API
	virDomainDiskDefForeachPath().

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c, src/qemu/qemu_security_dac.c,
	  src/security/security_selinux.c, src/security/virt-aa-helper.c:
	  Convert over to use virDomainDiskDefForeachPath()

	Add an API for iterating over disk paths
	There is duplicated code which iterates over disk backing stores
	performing some action. Provide a convenient helper for doing
	this to eliminate duplication & risk of mistakes with disk format
	probing

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h,
	  src/libvirt_private.syms: Add virDomainDiskDefForeachPath()

	Require format to be passed into virStorageFileGetMetadata
	Require the disk image to be passed into virStorageFileGetMetadata.
	If this is set to VIR_STORAGE_FILE_AUTO, then the format will be
	resolved using probing. This makes it easier to control when
	probing will be used

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c, src/qemu/qemu_security_dac.c,
	  src/security/security_selinux.c, src/security/virt-aa-helper.c:
	  Set VIR_STORAGE_FILE_AUTO when calling virStorageFileGetMetadata.
	* src/storage/storage_backend_fs.c: Probe for disk format before
	  calling virStorageFileGetMetadata.
	* src/util/storage_file.h, src/util/storage_file.c: Remove format
	  from virStorageFileMeta struct & require it to be passed into
	  method.

2010-07-19  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Refactor virStorageFileGetMetadataFromFD to separate functionality
	The virStorageFileGetMetadataFromFD did two jobs in one. First
	it probed for storage type, then it extracted metadata for the
	type. It is desirable to be able to separate these jobs, allowing
	probing without querying metadata, and querying metadata without
	probing.

	To prepare for this, split out probing code into a new pair of
	methods

	  virStorageFileProbeFormatFromFD
	  virStorageFileProbeFormat

	* src/util/storage_file.c, src/util/storage_file.h,
	  src/libvirt_private.syms: Introduce virStorageFileProbeFormat
	  and virStorageFileProbeFormatFromFD

	Remove 'type' field from FileTypeInfo struct
	Instead of including a field in FileTypeInfo struct for the
	disk format, rely on the array index matching the format.
	Use verify() to assert the correct number of elements in the
	array.

	* src/util/storage_file.c: remove type field from FileTypeInfo

	Extract the backing store format as well as name, if available
	When QEMU opens a backing store for a QCow2 file, it will
	normally auto-probe for the format of the backing store,
	rather than assuming it has the same format as the referencing
	file. There is a QCow2 extension that allows an explicit format
	for the backing store to be embedded in the referencing file.
	This closes the auto-probing security hole in QEMU.

	This backing store format can be useful for libvirt users
	of virStorageFileGetMetadata, so extract this data and report
	it.

	QEMU does not require disk image backing store files to be in
	the same format the file linkee. It will auto-probe the disk
	format for the backing store when opening it. If the backing
	store was intended to be a raw file this could be a security
	hole, because a guest may have written data into its disk that
	then makes the backing store look like a qcow2 file. If it can
	trick QEMU into thinking the raw file is a qcow2 file, it can
	access arbitrary files on the host by adding further backing
	store links.

	To address this, callers of virStorageFileGetMeta need to be
	told of the backing store format. If no format is declared,
	they can make a decision whether to allow format probing or
	not.

	CVE-2010-2242 Apply a source port mapping to virtual network masquerading
	IPtables will seek to preserve the source port unchanged when
	doing masquerading, if possible. NFS has a pseudo-security
	option where it checks for the source port <= 1023 before
	allowing a mount request. If an admin has used this to make the
	host OS trusted for mounts, the default iptables behaviour will
	potentially allow NAT'd guests access too. This needs to be
	stopped.

	With this change, the iptables -t nat -L -n -v rules for the
	default network will be

	man pages: update authors and copyright notice for libvirtd and virsh
	This patch removes the individual author names from the libvirtd and virsh
	man pages, instead referring to the main AUTHORS file distributed with
	libvirt.  This approach is needed, as we can't guarantee unicode support
	across all versions of pod2man used with libvirt.

	RFC: Canonicalize block device paths
	There are many naming conventions for partitions associated with a
	block device.  Some of the major ones are:

	/dev/foo -> /dev/foo1
	/dev/foo1 -> /dev/foo1p1
	/dev/mapper/foo -> /dev/mapper/foop1
	/dev/disk/by-path/foo -> /dev/disk/by-path/foo-part1

	The universe of possible conventions isn't clear.  Rather than trying
	to understand all possible conventions, this patch divides devices
	into two groups, device mapper devices and everything else.  Device
	mapper devices seem always to follow the convention of device ->
	devicep1; everything else is canonicalized.

	daemon: dispatch.c should include stdio.h (and stdarg.h)
	dispatch.c requires stdio.h (and stdarg.h), however, currently

	If rpc/xdr.h unxpectedly does not include stdio.h, the compilation
	of dispatch.c fails.

	This can happen, for example, when portablexdr is installed
	under /usr/local; because portablexdr's rpc/xdr.h does not
	include stdio.h and gcc looks up it not /usr/include/rpc/xdr.h.

	Note that stdarg.h is also included according to man va_start,

	When comparing a CPU without <model> element, such as

	    <cpu>
	        <topology sockets='1' cores='1' threads='1'/>
	    </cpu>

	libvirt would happily crash without warning.

	cpu: Fail when CPU type cannot be detected from XML
	When autodetecting whether XML describes guest or host CPU, the presence
	of <arch> element is checked. If it's present, we treat the XML as host
	CPU definition. Which is right, since guest CPU definitions do not
	contain <arch> element. However, if at the same time the root <cpu>
	element contains `match' attribute, we would silently ignore it and
	still treat the XML as host CPU. We should rather refuse such invalid
	XML.

	cpuCompare: Fix comparison of two host CPUs
	When a CPU to be compared with host CPU describes a host CPU instead of
	a guest CPU, the result is incorrect. This is because instead of
	treating additional features in host CPU description as required, they
	were treated as if they were mentioned with all possible policies at the
	same time.

	qemu: Use -nodefconfig when probing for CPU models
	In case qemu supports -nodefconfig, libvirt adds uses it when launching

	virsh: tweak help output for VSH_OT_DATA
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=609044 complained
	that 'virsh help pool-create-as' didn't document the shortcut
	that you can do 'virsh pool-create-as $name $type --target $target'
	rather than having to supply the four optional source- arguments
	in order to fill out the necessary positional arguments.

	This one-liner changes the help output to hopefully make this more obvious:

	  NAME
	    pool-create-as - create a pool from a set of args

	  SYNOPSIS
	    pool-create-as <name> [--print-xml] <type> [<source-host>] [<source-path>] [<source-dev>] [<source-name>] [<target>] [--source-format <string>]

	  DESCRIPTION
	    Create a pool.

	  OPTIONS
	    [--name] <string>  name of the pool
	    --print-xml      print XML document, but don't define/create
	    [--type] <string>  type of the pool
	    [--source-host] <string>  source-host for underlying storage
	    [--source-path] <string>  source path for underlying storage
	    [--source-dev] <string>  source device for underlying storage
	    [--source-name] <string>  source name for underlying storage
	    [--target] <string>  target for underlying storage
	    --source-format <string>  format for underlying storage

	Avoid invoking the qemu monitor destroy callback if the constructor fails
	Some, but not all, codepaths in the qemuMonitorOpen() method
	would trigger the destroy callback. The caller does not expect
	this to be invoked if construction fails, only during normal
	release of the monitor. This resulted in a possible double-unref
	of the virDomainObjPtr, because the caller explicitly unrefs
	the virDomainObjPtr  if qemuMonitorOpen() fails

	cgroup: Add missing errno == ENOENT check in virCgroupRemoveRecursively
	ENOENT happens normally when a subsystem is enabled with any other

	in a prior loop. In that case, the function should just return without
	leaving an error message.

	NB this is the same behavior as before introducing virCgroupRemoveRecursively.

	Fix crash when detaching devices from qemu domains.
	Make sure to *not* call qemuDomainPCIAddressReleaseAddr if
	QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_DEVICE is *not* set (for older qemu).  This
	prevents a crash when trying to do device detachment from
	a qemu guest.

	Check for active PCI devices when doing nodedevice operations.
	In the current libvirt PCI code, there is no checking whether
	a PCI device is in use by a guest when doing node device
	detach or reattach.  This causes problems when a device is
	assigned to a guest, and the administrator starts issuing
	nodedevice commands.  Make it so that we check the list
	of active devices when trying to detach/reattach, and only
	allow the operation if the device is not assigned to a guest.

	lxc: Fix virsh console doesn't work after restarting libvirtd
	Because tty path is unexpectedly not saved in the live configuration
	file of a domain, libvirtd cannot get the console of the domain back
	after restarting.

	The reason why the tty path isn't saved is that, to save the tty path,
	the save function, virDomainSaveConfig, requires that the target domain
	is running (pid != -1), however, lxc driver calls the function before
	starting the domain to pass the configuration to controller.

	To ensure to save the tty path, the patch lets lxc driver call the save
	function again after starting the domain.

	lxc: Fix error handlings in lxcContainerRenameAndEnableInterfaces
	The function is expected to return negative value on failure,
	however, it returns positive value when either setInterfaceName
	or vethInterfaceUpOrDown fails. Because the function returns
	the return value of either as is, however, the two functions
	may return positive value on failure.

	The patch fixes the defects and add error messages.

	lxc: Change VIR_ERROR to VIR_DEBUG for just a debugging message
	The message is actually not of error but of debugging.

	Selectively ignore domainSetSecurityAllLabel failure in domain restore
	When the saved domain image is on an NFS share, at least some part of
	domainSetSecurityAllLabel will fail (for example, selinux labels can't
	be modified). To allow domain restore to still work in this case, just
	ignore the errors.

	use virStorageFileIsSharedFS utility function in qemudDomainSaveFlag
	Previously, this function had it's own bit of code performing the same
	function. Since there's now an equivalent utility function, let's use it.

	Enhance virStorageFileIsSharedFS
	virStorageFileIsSharedFS would previously only work if the entire path
	in question was stat'able by the uid of the libvirtd process. This
	patch changes it to crawl backwards up the path retrying the statfs
	call until it gets to a partial path that *can* be stat'ed.

	This is necessary to use the function to learn the fstype for files
	stored as a different user (and readable only by that user) on a
	root-squashed remote filesystem.

	Set proper selinux label on image file during qemu domain restore
	Also restore the label to its original value after qemu is finished
	with the file.

	Prior to this patch, qemu domain restore did not function properly if
	selinux was set to enforce.

	phyp: reduce scope of driver functions
	Several phyp functions are not namespace clean, and had no reason
	to be exported since no one outside the phyp driver needed to use

	to topologically sort the file.  So, this patch looks huge, but
	is really just a matter of marking things static and dealing with
	the compiler fallout.

	Fix migration in text mode and shared storage migration in json mode
	The patches for shared storage migration were not correctly written
	for json mode. Thus the 'blk' and 'inc' parameters were never being
	set. In addition they didn't set the QEMU_MONITOR_MIGRATE_BACKGROUND
	so migration was synchronous. Due to multiple bugs in QEMU's JSON
	impl this wasn't noticed because it treated the sync migration requst
	as asynchronous anyway. Finally 'background' parameter was converted
	to take arbitrary flags but not renamed, and not all uses were changed
	to unsigned int.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Set QEMU_MONITOR_MIGRATE_BACKGROUND in
	  doNativeMigrate
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c: Process QEMU_MONITOR_MIGRATE_NON_SHARED_DISK
	  and QEMU_MONITOR_MIGRATE_NON_SHARED_INC flags

	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.h, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.h: change 'int background' to
	  'unsigned int flags' in migration APIs. Add logging of flags
	  parameter

	Avoid blocking all APIs during incoming migration
	During incoming migration the QEMU monitor is not able to be
	used. The incoming migration code did not keep hold of the
	job lock because migration is split across multiple API calls.
	This meant that further monitor commands on the guest would
	hang until migration finished with no timeout.

	In this change the qemuDomainMigratePrepare method sets the
	job flag just before it returns. The qemuDomainMigrateFinish
	method checks for this job flag & clears it once done. This
	prevents any use of the monitor between prepare+finish steps.

	The qemuDomainGetJobInfo method is also updated to refresh
	the job elapsed time. This means that virsh domjobinfo can
	return time data during incoming migration

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Keep a job active during incoming
	  migration. Refresh job elapsed time when returning job info

	Set labelling for character devices in security drivers
	When configuring serial, parallel, console or channel devices
	with a file, dev or pipe backend type, it is necessary to label
	the file path in the security drivers. For char devices of type
	file, it is neccessary to pre-create (touch) the file if it does
	not already exist since QEMU won't be allowed todo so itself.
	dev/pipe configs already require the admin to pre-create before
	starting the guest.

	* src/qemu/qemu_security_dac.c: set file ownership for character
	  devices
	* src/security/security_selinux.c: Set file labeling for character
	  devices
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Add character devices to cgroup ACL

	Add API for iterating over all character devices
	The parallel, serial, console and channel devices are all just
	character devices. A lot of code needs todo the same thing to
	all these devices. This provides an convenient API for iterating
	over all of them.

	esx: Use bool instead of int where appropriated

	esx: Add support for the controller element
	Also don't abuse the disk driver name to specify the SCSI controller
	model anymore:

	  <driver name='buslogic'/>

	Use the newly added model attribute of the controller element for this:

	  <controller type='scsi' index='0' model='buslogic'/>

	The disk driver name approach is deprecated now, but still works for
	backward compatibility reasons.

	Update the documentation and tests accordingly.

	Fix usage of the words controller and id in the VMX handling code. Use
	controller, bus and unit properly.

	Add optional model attribute to the controller element
	This is a step towards controller support for the ESX driver.

	Add wide SCSI bus disk address generation support
	The domain XML parsing code autogenerates disk address and
	controller elements when they are not explicitly specified.
	The code assumes a narrow SCSI bus (7 units per bus). ESX
	uses a wide SCSI bus (16 units per bus).

	This is a step towards controller support for the ESX driver.

	Cleanup some LIBADD and CFLAGS
	Move libnl to libvirt_util.la, because macvtap.c requires it.

	Add GnuTLS to libvirt_driver.la, because libvirt.c calls gcrypt functions.
	When built without loadable driver modules, then the remote driver pulls
	in GnuTLS.

	Move libgnu.la from libvirt_parthelper_CFLAGS to libvirt_parthelper_LDADD.

	cgroup: Enable memory.use_hierarchy of cgroup for domain
	Through conversation with Kumar L Srikanth-B22348, I found
	that the function of getting memory usage (e.g., virsh dominfo)
	doesn't work for lxc with ns subsystem of cgroup enabled.

	This is because of features of ns and memory subsystems.
	Ns creates child cgroup on every process fork and as a result
	processes in a container are not assigned in a cgroup for
	domain (e.g., libvirt/lxc/test1/). For example, libvirt_lxc
	and init (or somewhat specified in XML) are assigned into
	libvirt/lxc/test1/8839/ and libvirt/lxc/test1/8839/8849/,
	respectively. On the other hand, memory subsystem accounts
	memory usage within a group of processes by default, i.e.,
	it does not take any child (and descendant) groups into
	account. With the two features, virsh dominfo which just
	checks memory usage of a cgroup for domain always returns
	zero because the cgroup has no process.

	Setting memory.use_hierarchy of a group allows to account
	(and limit) memory usage of every descendant groups of the group.
	By setting it of a cgroup for domain, we can get proper memory
	usage of lxc with ns subsystem enabled. (To be exact, the
	setting is required only when memory and ns subsystems are
	enabled at the same time, e.g., mount -t cgroup none /cgroup.)

	cgroup: Change virCgroupRemove to remove all descendant groups at first
	As same as normal directories, a cgroup cannot be removed if it
	contains sub groups. This patch changes virCgroupRemove to remove
	all descendant groups (subdirectories) of a target group before
	removing the target group.

	The handling is required when we run lxc with ns subsystem of cgroup.
	Ns subsystem automatically creates child cgroups on every process
	forks, but unfortunately the groups are not removed on process exits,
	so we have to remove them by ourselves.

	With this patch, such child (and descendant) groups are surely removed
	at lxc shutdown, i.e., lxcVmCleanup which calls virCgroupRemove.

	Add '-nodefconfig' command line arg to QEMU
	We already use the '-nodefaults' command line arg with QEMU to stop
	it adding any default devices to guests. Unfortunately, QEMU will
	load global config files from /etc/qemu that may also add default
	devices. These aren't blocked by '-nodefaults', so we need to also
	add the '-nodefconfig' arg to prevent that.

	Unfortunately these global config files are also used to define
	custom CPU models. So in blocking global hardware device addition
	we also block definitions of new CPU models. Libvirt doesn't know
	about these custom CPU models though, so it would never make use
	of them anyway. Thus blocking them via -nodefconfig isn't a show
	stopping problem. We would need to expand libvirt's own CPU model
	XML database to support these instead.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Add '-nodefconfig' if available
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/: Add '-nodefconfig' to all data files which
	  have '-nodefaults' present

	Fix reference handling leak on qemuMonitor
	The current code pattern requires that callers of qemuMonitorClose
	check for the return value == 0, and if so, set priv->mon = NULL
	and release the reference held on the associated virDomainObjPtr

	The change d84bb6d6a3bd2fdd530184cc9743249ebddbee71 violated that
	requirement, meaning that priv->mon never gets set to NULL, and
	a reference count is leaked on virDomainObjPtr.

	This design was a bad one, so remove the need to check the return
	valueof qemuMonitorClose(). Instead allow registration of a
	callback that's invoked just when the last reference on qemuMonitorPtr
	is released.

	Finally there was a potential reference leak in qemuConnectMonitor
	in the failure path.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h: Add a destroy
	  callback invoked from qemuMonitorFree
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Use the destroy callback to release the
	  reference on virDomainObjPtr when the monitor is freed. Fix other
	  potential reference count leak in connecting to monitor

	Make checks for inactive QEMU guest more robust
	Before issuing monitor commands it is neccessary to check whether
	the guest is still running. Most places use virDomainIsActive()
	correctly, but a few relied on 'priv->mon != NULL'. In theory
	these should be equivalent, but the release of the last reference
	count on priv->mon can be delayed a small amount of time until
	the event handler is finally deregistered. A further ref counting
	bug also means that priv->mon might be never released. In such a
	case, code could mistakenly issue a monitor command and wait for
	a response that will never arrive, effectively leaving the QEMU
	driver waiting on virCondWait() forever..

	To protect against these possibilities, make sure all code uses
	virDomainIsActive(), not 'priv->mon != NULL'

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Replace 'priv->mon != NULL' with
	  calls to 'priv->mon != NULL'()

	Improve some error messages about unsupported APIs/URIs
	If there is no driver for a URI we report

	  "no hypervisor driver available"

	This is bad because not all virt drivers are hypervisors (ie container
	based virt).

	If there is no driver support for an API we report

	  "this function is not supported by the hypervisor"

	This is bad for the same reason, and additionally because it is
	also used for the network, interface & storage drivers.

	Don't leak open fd to virsh in libvirt-guests init script
	Running virsh while having /var/lib/libvirt/libvirt-guests file open
	makes SELinux emit messages about preventing virsh from reading that

	nwfilter: fix loadable module support
	Following Daniel Berrange's multiple helpful suggestions for improving
	this patch and introducing another driver interface, I now wrote the
	below patch where the nwfilter driver registers the functions to
	instantiate and teardown the nwfilters with a function in
	conf/domain_nwfilter.c called virDomainConfNWFilterRegister. Previous
	helper functions that were called from qemu_driver.c and qemu_conf.c
	were move into conf/domain_nwfilter.h with slight renaming done for
	consistency. Those functions now call the function expored by
	domain_nwfilter.c, which in turn call the functions of the new driver
	interface, if available.

	virsh: remove a doubled up include for errno.h

2010-06-21  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Misc cleanups
	- Fix documentation for virGetStorageVol: it has 'key' argument instead
	  of 'uuid'.
	- Remove TODO comment from virReleaseStorageVol: we use volume key as an
	  identifier instead of UUID.
	- Print human-readable UUID string in debug message in virReleaseSecret.

	Do not free static buffer with UUID
	As anywhere else, uuid is defined as a fixed size array inside
	_virSecret structure; we shouldn't try to free it.

	Remove unnecessary check for non-NULL uuid
	The first thing we do in all these functions is to check uuid != NULL
	and fail if it isn't.

	Index hashes by UUID instead of name
	Per-connection hashes for domains, networks, storage pools and network
	filter pools were indexed by names which was not the best choice. UUIDs
	are better identifiers, so lets use them.

	Add several missing vir*Free calls in libvirtd's remote code
	Justin Clift reported a problem with adding virStoragePoolIsPersistent
	to virsh's pool-info command, resulting in a strange problem. Here's
	an example:

	    virsh # pool-create-as images_dir3 dir - - - - "/home/images2"
	    Pool images_dir3 created

	    virsh # pool-info images_dir3
	    Name:           images_dir3
	    UUID:           90301885-94eb-4ca7-14c2-f30b25a29a36
	    State:          running
	    Capacity:       395.20 GB
	    Allocation:     30.88 GB
	    Available:      364.33 GB

	    virsh # pool-destroy images_dir3
	    Pool images_dir3 destroyed

	At this point the images_dir3 pool should be gone (because it was
	transient) and we should be able to create a new pool with the same name:

	    virsh # pool-create-as images_dir3 dir - - - - "/home/images2"
	    Pool images_dir3 created

	    virsh # pool-info images_dir3
	    Name:           images_dir3
	    UUID:           90301885-94eb-4ca7-14c2-f30b25a29a36
	    error: Storage pool not found

	The new pool got the same UUID as the first one, but we didn't specify
	one. libvirt should have picked a random UUID, but it didn't.

	It turned out that virStoragePoolIsPersistent leaks a reference to the
	storage pool object (actually remoteDispatchStoragePoolIsPersistent does).
	As a result, pool-destroy doesn't remove the virStoragePool for the
	"images_dir3" pool from the virConnectPtr's storagePools hash on libvirtd's
	side. Then the second pool-create-as get's the stale virStoragePool object
	associated with the "images_dir3" name. But this object has the old UUID.

	This commit ensures that all get_nonnull_* and make_nonnull_* calls for
	libvirt objects are matched properly with vir*Free calls. This fixes the
	reference leaks and the reported problem.

	All remoteDispatch*IsActive and remoteDispatch*IsPersistent functions were
	affected. But also remoteDispatchDomainMigrateFinish2 was affected in the
	success path. I wonder why that didn't surface earlier. Probably because
	domainMigrateFinish2 is executed on the destination host and in the common
	case this connection is opened especially for the migration and gets closed
	after the migration is done. So there was no chance to run into a problem
	because of the leaked reference.

	Fix auto-adding of virtio serial controllers
	The domain parsing code would auto-add a virtio serial controller
	if it saw any virtio serial channel defined. Unfortunately it
	always added a controller with index=0, even if the channel address
	specified an index != 0. It only added one controller, even if
	multiple controllers were referenced by channels. Finally, it let
	the ports+vectors parameters initialize to zero instead of -1, which
	prevented the controllers accepting any ports.

	Adjust block size used by dd to speed QEMU domain save operations.
	See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=599091

	Saving a paused 512MB domain took 3m47s with the old block size of 512
	bytes. Changing the block size to 1024*1024 decreased the time to 56
	seconds. (Doubling again to 2048*1024 yielded 0 improvement; lowering
	to 512k increased the save time to 1m10s, about 20%)

	Fix dereference of potentially freed pointer in qemudDomainSaveFlags
	The pointer to the xml describing the domain is saved into an object
	prior to calling VIR_REALLOC_N() to make the size of the memory it
	points to a multiple of QEMU_MONITOR_MIGRATE_TO_FILE_BS. If that
	operation needs to allocate new memory, the pointer that was saved is
	no longer valid.

	To avoid this situation, adjust the size *before* saving the pointer.

	(This showed up when experimenting with very large values of
	QEMU_MONITOR_MIGRATE_TO_FILE_BS).

	phyp: Strict check when listing domains

2010-06-03  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@us.ibm.com>

	add 802.1Qbh and 802.1Qbg handling
	This patch that adds support for configuring 802.1Qbg and 802.1Qbh
	switches. The 802.1Qbh part has been successfully tested with real
	hardware. The 802.1Qbg part has only been tested with a (dummy)
	server that 'behaves' similarly to how we expect lldpad to 'behave'.

	The following changes were made during the development of this patch:

	 - Merging Scott's v13-pre1 patch
	 - Fixing endptr related bug while using virStrToLong_ui() pointed out
	   by Jim Meyering
	 - Addressing Jim Meyering's comments to v11
	 - requiring mac address to the vpDisassociateProfileId() function to
	   pass it further to the 802.1Qbg disassociate part (802.1Qbh untouched)
	 - determining pid of lldpad daemon by reading it from /var/run/libvirt.pid
	   (hardcode as is hardcode alson in lldpad sources)
	 - merging netlink send code for kernel target and user space target
	   (lldpad) using one function nlComm() to send the messages
	 - adding a select() after the sending and before the reading of the
	   netlink response in case lldpad doesn't respond and so we don't hang
	 - when reading the port status, in case of 802.1Qbg, no status may be
	   received while things are 'in progress' and only at the end a status
	   will be there.
	 - when reading the port status, use the given instanceId and vf to pick
	   the right IFLA_VF_PORT among those nested under IFLA_VF_PORTS.
	 - never sending nor parsing IFLA_PORT_SELF type of messages in the
	   802.1Qbg case
	 - iterating over the elements in a IFLA_VF_PORTS to pick the right
	   IFLA_VF_PORT by either IFLA_PORT_PROFILE and given profileId
	   (802.1Qbh) or IFLA_PORT_INSTANCE_UUID and given instanceId (802.1Qbg)
	   and reading the current status in IFLA_PORT_RESPONSE.
	 - recycling a previous patch that adds functionality to interface.c to
	   - get the vlan identifier on an interface
	   - get the flags of an interface and some convenience function to
	     check whether an interface is 'up' or not (not currently used here)
	 - adding function to determine the root physical interface of an
	   interface. For example if a macvtap is linked to eth0.100, it will
	   find eth0. Also adding a function that finds the vlan on the 'way to
	   the root physical interface'
	 - conveying the root physical interface name and index in case of 802.1Qbg
	 - conveying mac address of macvlan device and vlan identifier in
	   IFLA_VFINFO_LIST[ IFLA_VF_INFO[ IFLA_VF_MAC(mac), IFLA_VF_VLAN(vlan) ] ]
	   to (future) lldpad via netlink
	  - To enable build with --without-macvtap rename the
	    [dis|]associatePortProfileId functions, prepend 'vp' before their
	    name and make them non-static functions.
	  - Renaming variable multicast to nltarget_kernel and inverting
	    the logic
	  - Addressing Jim Meyering's comments; this also touches existing
	    code for example for correcting indentation of break statements or
	    simplification of switch statements.
	  - Renamed occurrencvirVirtualPortProfileDef to virVirtualPortProfileParamses
	  - 802.1Qbg part prepared for sending a RTM_SETLINK and getting
	    processing status back plus a subsequent RTM_GETLINK to
	    get IFLA_PORT_RESPONSE.
	    Note: This interface for 802.1Qbg may still change
	  - [David Allan] move getPhysfn inside IFLA_VF_PORT_MAX to avoid
	compiler
	    warning when latest if_link.h isn't available
	  - move from Stefan's 802.1Qb{g|h} XML v8 to v9
	  - move hostuuid and vf index calcs to inside doPortProfileOp8021Qbh
	  - remove debug fprintfs
	  - use virGetHostUUID (thanks Stefan!)
	  - fix compile issue when latest if_link.h isn't available
	  - change poll timeout to 10s, at 1/8 intervals
	     - if polling times out, log msg and return -ETIMEDOUT
	  - Add Stefan's code for getPortProfileStatus
	  - Poll for up to 2 secs for port-profile status, at 1/8 sec intervals:
	     - if status indicates error, abort openMacvtapTap
	     - if status indicates success, exit polling
	     - if status is "in-progress" after 2 secs of polling, exit
	       polling loop silently, without error

	My patch finishes out the 802.1Qbh parts, which Stefan had mostly complete.
	I've tested using the recent kernel updates for VF_PORT netlink msgs and
	enic for Cisco's 10G Ethernet NIC.  I tested many VMs, each with several
	direct interfaces, each configured with a port-profile per the XML.  VM-to-VM,
	and VM-to-external work as expected.  VM-to-VM on same host (using same NIC)
	works same as VM-to-VM where VMs are on diff hosts.  I'm able to change
	settings on the port-profile while the VM is running to change the virtual
	port behaviour.  For example, adjusting a QoS setting like rate limit.  All
	VMs with interfaces using that port-profile immediatly see the effect of the
	change to the port-profile.

	I don't have a SR-IOV device to test so source dev is a non-SR-IOV device,
	but most of the code paths include support for specifing the source dev and
	VF index.  We'll need to complete this by discovering the PF given the VF
	linkdev.  Once we have the PF, we'll also have the VF index.  All this info-
	mation is available from sysfs.

	Add --source-format argument to virsh pool-define-as and pool-create-as
	This is the corresponding patch for the virsh man page (virsh.pod).

	Add --source-format argument to virsh pool-define-as and pool-create-as
	When creating pools from dedicated disks, the existing pool-define-as
	and pool-create-as commands are a bit non-optimal.

	Ideally, a person would be able to specify all of the required options
	directly on the command line instead of having to edit the XML.

	At the moment, there is no way to specify the format type (ie gpt) so it
	gets included in the XML the pool is constructed with.

	Please find attached a simple (tested) patch to add an optional
	"--source-format 'type'" to virsh.  This is patched against current git
	master and will apply cleanly.

	Also created a Red Hat BZ ticket for this (#597790) for tracking.

	Trivial virsh.pod additions --all for "list" command and similar
	This is just a trivial patch to virsh.pod (from git master). It adds the

	    Closes Bugzilla #575512, reported by Renich Bon Ciric
	    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=575512

	  + Corrects the existing description of the list command, to now say
	    that only running domains are listed if no domains are specified.

	    The man page up until this point has said all domains are listed if
	    no domains are specified, which is incorrect.

	  + Adds the "shut off" state to the list of states for the list
	    command.

	  + Adds a missing =back around line 755, that pod2man was complaining
	    was missing.

	storage: Check for invalid storage mode before opening
	If a directory pool contains pipes or sockets, a pool start can fail or hang:

	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=589577

	We already try to avoid these special files, but only attempt after
	opening the path, which is where the problems lie. Unify volume opening
	into helper functions, which use the proper open() flags to avoid error,
	followed by fstat to validate storage mode.

	Previously, virStorageBackendUpdateVolTargetInfoFD attempted to enforce the
	storage mode check, but allowed callers to detect this case and silently
	continue. In practice, only the FS backend was using this feature, the rest
	were treating unknown mode as an error condition. Unfortunately the InfoFD
	function wasn't raising an error message here, so error reporting was
	busted.

	This patch adds 2 functions: virStorageBackendVolOpen, and
	virStorageBackendVolOpenModeSkip. The latter retains the original opt out
	semantics, the former now throws an explicit error.

	This patch maintains the previous volume mode checks: allowing specific
	modes for specific pool types requires a bit of surgery, since VolOpen
	is called through several different helper functions.

	v2: Use ATTRIBUTE_NONNULL. Drop stat check, just open with
	    O_NONBLOCK|O_NOCTTY.

	v3: Move mode check logic back to VolOpen. Use 2 VolOpen functions with
	    different error semantics.

	v4: Make second VolOpen function more extensible. Didn't opt to change
	    FS backend defaults, this can just be to fix the original bug.

	v5: Prefix default flags with VIR_, use ATTRIBUTE_RETURN_CHECK

	macvtap: cannot support target device name
	Since the macvtap device needs active tear-down and the teardown logic
	is based on the interface name, it can happen that if for example 1 out
	of 3 interfaces was successfully created, that during the failure path
	the macvtap's target device name is used to tear down an interface that
	is doesn't own (owned by another VM).

	So, in this patch, the target interface name is reset so that there is
	no target interface name and the interface name is always cleared after
	a tear down.

	Fix failing virGetHostname.
	We've been running into a lot of situations where
	virGetHostname() is returning "localhost", where a plain
	gethostname() would have returned the correct thing.  This
	is because virGetHostname() is *always* trying to canonicalize
	the name returned from gethostname(), even when it doesn't
	have to.

	This patch changes virGetHostname so that if the value returned
	from gethostname() is already FQDN or localhost, it returns
	that string directly.  If the value returned from gethostname()
	is a shortened hostname, then we try to canonicalize it.  If
	that succeeds, we returned the canonicalized hostname.  If
	that fails, and/or returns "localhost", then we just return
	the original string we got from gethostname() and hope for
	the best.

	Note that after this patch it is up to clients to check whether
	"localhost" is an allowed return value.  The only place
	where it's currently not is in qemu migration.

	vepa: parsing for 802.1Qb{g|h} XML
	This patch parses the following two XML descriptions, one for
	802.1Qbg and one for 802.1Qbh, and stores the data internally.
	The actual triggering of the switch setup protocol has not been
	implemented here but the relevant code to do that should go into
	the functions associatePortProfileId() and disassociatePortProfileId().

	   <interface type='direct'>
	      <source dev='eth0.100' mode='vepa'/>
	      <model type='virtio'/>
	      <virtualport type='802.1Qbg'>
	        <parameters managerid='12' typeid='0x123456' typeidversion='1'
	         instanceid='fa9b7fff-b0a0-4893-8e0e-beef4ff18f8f'/>
	      </virtualport>
	      <filterref filter='clean-traffic'/>
	    </interface>

	    <interface type='direct'>
	      <source dev='eth0.100' mode='vepa'/>
	      <model type='virtio'/>
	      <virtualport type='802.1Qbh'>
	        <parameters profileid='my_profile'/>
	      </virtualport>
	    </interface>

	I'd suggest to use this patch as a base for triggering the setup
	protocol with the 802.1Qb{g|h} switch.

	Several rounds of changes were made to this patch. The
	following is a list of these changes.
	- Renamed structure virVirtualPortProfileDef to virVirtualPortProfileParams
	  as per Daniel Berrange's request
	- Addressing Daniel Berrange's comments:
	 - removing macvtap.h's dependency on domain_conf.h by
	   moving the virVirtualPortProfileDef structure into macvtap.h
	   and not passing virtDomainNetDefPtr to any functions in
	   macvtap.c
	- Addressed most of Chris Wright's comments:
	  - indicating error in case virtualport XML node cannot be parsed
	    properly
	  - parsing hex and decimal numbers using virStrToLong_ui() with
	    parameter '0' for base
	  - tgifname (target interface name) variable wasn't necessary
	    to pass to openMacvtapTap function anymore
	- assigning the virtual port data structure to the virDomainNetDef
	  only if it was previously parsed
	- make sure that the error code returned by openMacvtapTap() is a negative n
	  in case the associatePortProfileId() function failed.
	- renaming vsi in the XML to virtualport
	- replace all occurrences of vsi in the source as well
	- removing mode and MAC address parameters from the functions that
	  will communicate with the hareware diretctly or indirectly
	- moving the associate and disassociate functions to the end of the
	  file for subsequent patches to easier make them generally available
	  for export
	- passing the macvtap interface name rather than the link device since
	  this otherwise gives funny side effects when using netlink messages
	  where IFLA_IFNAME and IFLA_ADDRESS are specified and the link dev
	  all of a sudden gets the MAC address of the macvtap interface.
	- Removing rc = -1 error indications in the case of 802.1Qbg|h setup in case
	  we wanted to use hook scripts for the setup and so the setup doesn't fail
	  here.
	- if instance ID UUID is not supplied it will automatically be generated
	  - adapted schema to make instance ID UUID optional
	  - added test case
	- parser and XML generator have been separated into their own
	  functions so they can be re-used elsewhere (passthrough case
	  for example)
	- Adapted XML parser and generator support the above shown type
	  (802.1Qbg, 802.1Qbh).
	- Adapted schema to above XML
	- Adapted test XML to above XML
	- Passing through the VM's UUID which seems to be necessary for
	  802.1Qbh -- sorry no host UUID
	- adding virtual function ID to association function, in case it's
	  necessary to use (for SR-IOV)

	vepa+vsi: Introduce dependency on libnl
	This patch introduces a dependency on libnl, which subsequent patches
	will then use.

	Changes from V1 to V2:
	- added diffstats
	- following changes in tree

	storage: Sanitize pool target paths
	Spurious / in a pool target path makes life difficult for apps using the

	Fix handling of disk backing stores with cgroups
	The cgroups ACL code was only allowing the primary disk image.
	It is possible to chain images together, so we need to search
	for backing stores and add them to the ACL too. Since the ACL
	only handles block devices, we ignore the EINVAL we get from
	plain files. In addition it was missing code to teardown the
	cgroup when hot-unplugging a disk

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Allow backing stores in cgroup ACLs
	  and add missing teardown code in unplug path

	Fix up basic migration.
	Basic live migration was broken by the commit that added
	non-shared block support in two ways:

	1)  It added a virCheckFlags() to doNativeMigrate().  Besides
	the fact that typical usage of virCheckFlags() is in driver
	entry points, and doNativeMigrate() is not an entry point,
	it was missing important flags like VIR_MIGRATE_LIVE.  Move
	the virCheckFlags to the top-level qemuDomainMigratePrepare2
	and friends.

	2)  It also added a memory leak in qemuMonitorTextMigrate()
	by not freeing the memory used by virBufferContentAndReset().
	This is fixed by storing the pointer in a temporary variable
	and freeing it at the end.

	With this patch in place, normal live migration works again.

	v3: Instead of the churn for virCheckFlagsUI and UL, instead
	always promote flags to an unsigned long and always use %lx
	for the fprintf.
	v2: Add back flags check, which required adding virCheckFlagsUI
	and virCheckFlagsUL

	qemu: Allow using regular audio backends with VNC
	Currently all host audio backends are disabled if a VM is using VNC, in
	favor of the QEMU VNC audio extension. Unfortunately no released VNC
	client supports this extension, so users have no way of getting audio
	to work if using VNC.

	Add a new config option in qemu.conf which allows changing libvirt's
	behavior, but keep the default intact.

	v2: Fix doc typos, change name to vnc_allow_host_audio

	Query block allocation extent from QEMU monitor
	The virDomainGetBlockInfo API allows query physical block
	extent and allocated block extent. These are normally the
	same value unless storing a special format like qcow2
	inside a block device. In this scenario we can query QEMU
	to get the actual allocated extent.

	Since last time:

	 - Only invoke monitor command for block devices
	 - Fix error handling JSON code

	Fix race in finding available vnc port
	The qemu driver contains a subtle race in the logic to find next
	available vnc port.  Currently it iterates through all available ports
	and returns the first for which bind(2) succeeds.  However it is possible
	that a previously issued port has not yet been bound by qemu, resulting
	in the same port used for a subsequent domain.

	This patch addresses the race by using a simple bitmap to "reserve" the
	ports allocated by libvirt.

	V2:
	  - Put port bitmap in struct qemud_driver
	  - Initialize bitmap in qemudStartup

	V3:
	  - Check for failure of virBitmapGetBit
	  - Additional check for port != -1 before calling virbitmapClearBit

	V4:
	  - Check for failure of virBitmap{Set,Clear}Bit

	Add defines for QEMU_VNC_PORT_{MIN,MAX} and use them

	Add simple bitmap operations to utils
	V2:
	  - Move bitmap impl to src/util/bitmap.[ch]
	  - Use CHAR_BIT instead of explicit '8'
	  - Use size_t instead of unsigned int
	  - Fix calculation of bitmap size in virBitmapAlloc
	  - Ensure bit is within range of map in the set, clear, and get
	    operations
	  - Use bool in virBitmapGetBit
	  - Add virBitmapFree to free-like funcs in cfg.mk

	V3:
	  - Check for overflow in virBitmapAlloc
	  - Fix copy and paste bug in virBitmapAlloc
	  - Use size_t in prototypes
	  - Add ATTRIBUTE_NONNULL in prototypes where appropriate
	    and remove NULL check from impl

	V4:
	  - Add ATTRIBUTE_RETURN_CHECK in prototypes where appropriate.

	Autostart domains using virDomainObjStart

	Refactor qemudDomainStart
	We need a common internal function for starting managed domains to be
	used during autostart. This patch factors out relevant code from
	qemudDomainStart into qemudDomainObjStart and makes it use the
	refactored code for domain restore instead of calling qemudDomainRestore
	API directly.

	Factor out def assignment to existing domain from virDomainAssignDef
	We need to be able to assign new def to an existing virDomainObj which
	is already locked. This patch factors out the relevant code from
	virDomainAssignDef into virDomainObjAssignDef.

	Refactor qemudDomainRestore
	We need to be able to restore a domain which we already locked and
	started a job for it without undoing these steps. This patch factors
	out internals of qemudDomainRestore into separate functions which work
	for locked objects.

	Domain snapshot RNG and tests.

	Fix up the python bindings for snapshotting.
	This involved a few fixes.  To start with,
	an virDomainSnapshot object is really tied to a
	domain, not a connection, so we have to generate
	a slightly different object so that we can get
	at self._dom for the object.

	Next, we had to "dummy" up an override piece of
	XML with a bogus argument that the function doesn't
	actually take.  That's so that the generator places
	virDomainRevertToSnapshot underneath the correct
	class (namely, the virDomain class).

	Finally, we had to hand-implement the
	virDomainRevertToSnapshot implementation, ignoring the
	bogus pointer we are being passed.

	With all of this in place, I was able to successfully
	take a snapshot and revert to it using only the
	Python bindings.

	Protect against NULL pointer flaws in monitor usage
	History has shown that there are frequent bugs in the QEMU driver
	code leading to the monitor being invoked with a NULL pointer.
	Although the QEMU driver code should always report an error in
	this case before invoking the monitor, as a safety net put in a
	generic check in the monitor code entry points.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c: Safety net to check for NULL monitor
	  object

	Fix multiple potential NULL pointer references in monitor usage
	Any method which intends to invoke a monitor command must have
	a check for virDomainObjIsActive() before using the monitor to
	ensure that priv->mon != NULL.

	There is one subtle edge case in this though. If a method invokes
	multiple monitor commands, and calls qemuDomainObjExitMonitor()
	in between two of these commands then there is no guarentee that
	priv->mon != NULL anymore. This is because the QEMU process may
	exit or die at any time, and because qemuDomainObjEnterMonitor()
	releases the lock on virDomainObj, it is possible for the background
	thread to close the monitor handle and thus qemuDomainObjExitMonitor
	will release the last reference allowing priv->mon to become NULL.

	This affects several methods, most notably migration but also some
	hotplug methods. This patch takes a variety of approaches to solve
	the problem, depending on the particular usage scenario. Generally
	though it suffices to add an extra virDomainObjIsActive() check
	if qemuDomainObjExitMonitor() was called during the method.

	Make domain save work when dynamic_ownership=0
	Setting dynamic_ownership=0 in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf prevents
	libvirt's DAC security driver from setting uid/gid on disk
	files when starting/stopping QEMU, allowing the admin to manage
	this manually. As a side effect it also stopped setting of
	uid/gid when saving guests to a file, which completely breaks
	save when QEMU is running non-root. Thus saved state labelling
	code must ignore the dynamic_ownership parameter

	* src/qemu/qemu_security_dac.c: Ignore dynamic_ownership=0 when
	  doing save/restore image labelling

	Don't reset user/group/security label on shared filesystems during migrate
	When QEMU runs with its disk on NFS, and as a non-root user, the
	disk is chownd to that non-root user. When migration completes
	the last step is shutting down the QEMU on the source host. THis
	normally resets user/group/security label. This is bad when the
	VM was just migrated because the file is still in use on the dest
	host. It is thus neccessary to skip the reset step for any files
	found to be on a shared filesystem

	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Export virStorageFileIsSharedFS
	* src/util/storage_file.c, src/util/storage_file.h: Add a new

	Fix handling of disk backing stores with cgroups
	The cgroups ACL code was only allowing the primary disk image.
	It is possible to chain images together, so we need to search
	for backing stores and add them to the ACL too. Since the ACL
	only handles block devices, we ignore the EINVAL we get from
	plain files. In addition it was missing code to teardown the
	cgroup when hot-unplugging a disk

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Allow backing stores in cgroup ACLs
	  and add missing teardown code in unplug path

	Fix possible crash in handling IO Error event
	If the IO error event does not include a reason, then there
	is a possible crash dispatching the event

	* src/conf/domain_event.c: Missing check for a NULL reason before
	  strduping allows for a crash

	Add support for NIC hotplug using netdev_add in QEMU
	QEMU is gaining a new monitor command netdev_add for hotplugging
	NICs using the netdev backend code. We already support this on
	the command this, though it is disabled. This adds support for
	hotplug too, also to remain disabled until 0.13 QEMU is released

2010-05-12  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Fix monitor ref counting when adding event handle
	When closing a monitor using qemuMonitorClose(), we are aware of
	the possibility the monitor is still being used somewhere:

	    /* NB: ordinarily one might immediately set mon->watch to -1
	     * and mon->fd to -1, but there may be a callback active
	     * that is still relying on these fields being valid. So
	     * we merely close them, but not clear their values and
	     * use this explicit 'closed' flag to track this state */

	but since we call virEventAddHandle() on that monitor without increasing
	its ref counter, the monitor is still freed which makes possible users
	of it quite unhappy. The unhappiness can lead to a hang if qemuMonitorIO
	tries to lock mutex which no longer exists.

	Remove watches before calling REMOTE_PROC_CLOSE
	First calling REMOTE_PROC_CLOSE and then removing watches might lead to
	a hang as HANGUP event can be triggered before the watches are actually
	removed but after virConnectPtr is already freed. As a result of that
	remoteDomainEventFired() would try to lock uninitialized mutex, which
	would hang for ever.

	nwfilter: skip some interfaces on filter update
	When a filter is updated, only those interfaces must have their old
	rules cleared that either reference the filter directly or indirectly
	through another filter. Remember between the different steps of the

	using a hash map to remember the names of the interfaces and store a

	pass info where request stems from to have rules applied
	For the decision on whether to instantiate the rules, the check for a
	pending IP address learn request is not sufficient since then only the
	thread could instantiate the rules. So, a boolean needs to be passed
	when the thread instantiates the filter rules late and the IP address
	learn request is still pending in order to override the check for the
	pending learn request. If the rules are to be updated while the thread
	is active, this will not be done immediately but the thread will do that

	Prevent updates while IP address learn thread is running
	Prevent updating and tearing down of filter while the IP
	address learning thread is running and has its own filtering
	rules applied.

	Syncronize the teardown of rules with the thread
	Introduce a function to notify the IP address learning
	thread to terminate and thus release the lock on the interface.
	Notify the thread before grabbing the lock on the interface
	and tearing down the rules. This prevents a 'virsh destroy' to
	tear down the rules that the IP address learning thread has
	applied.

	Clean all tables before applying 'basic' rules
	The functions invoked by the IP address learning thread
	that apply some basic filtering rules did not clean up
	any previous filtering rules that may still be there
	(due to a libvirt restart for example). With the
	patch below all the rules are cleaned up first.

	Also, I am introducing a function to drop all traffic
	in case the IP address learning thread could not apply
	the rules.

	Fix handling of security driver restore failures in QEMU domain save
	In cases where the security driver failed to restore a label after a
	guest has saved, we mistakenly jumped to the error cleanup paths.
	This is not good, because the operation has in fact completed and
	cannot be rolled back completely. Label restore is non-critical, so
	just log the problem instead. Also add a missing restore call in
	the error cleanup path

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Fix handling of security driver
	  restore failures in QEMU domain save

	Fix QEMU domain save to block devices with cgroups enabled
	When cgroups is enabled, access to block devices is likely to be
	restricted to a whitelist. Prior to saving a guest to a block device,
	it is necessary to add the block device to the whitelist. This is
	not required upon restore, since QEMU reads from stdin

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Add block device to cgroups whitelist
	  if neccessary during domain save.

	Fix QEMU save/restore with block devices
	The save process was relying on use of the shell >> append
	operator to ensure the save data was placed after the libvirt
	header + XML. This doesn't work for block devices though.
	Replace this code with use of 'dd' and its 'seek' parameter.
	This means that we need to pad the header + XML out to a
	multiple of dd block size (in this case we choose 512).

	The qemuMonitorMigateToCommand() monitor API is used for both
	save/coredump, and migration via UNIX socket. We can't simply
	switch this to use 'dd' since this causes problems with the
	migration usage. Thus, create a dedicated qemuMonitorMigateToFile
	which can accept an filename + offset, and remove the filename
	from the current qemuMonitorMigateToCommand() API

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Switch to qemuMonitorMigateToFile
	  for save and core dump
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.h: Create
	  a new qemuMonitorMigateToFile, separate from the existing
	  qemuMonitorMigateToCommand to allow handling file offsets

	Avoid create/unlink with block devs used for QEMU save
	It is possible to use block devices with domain save/restore. Upon
	failure QEMU unlinks the path being saved to. This isn't good when
	it is a block device !

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Don't unlink block devices if save fails

	Fix crash when cleaning up from failed save attempt
	If a transient QEMU crashes during save attempt, then the virDomainPtr
	object may be freed. If a persistent QEMU crashes during save, then
	the 'priv->mon' field is no longer valid since it will be inactive.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Fix two crashes when QEMU exits
	  during a save attempt

	nwfilter: let qemu's after-migration packet pass
	Qemu currently sends an Ethernet packet with protocol id 0x835 once a VM
	was successfully migrated. The content of the packet looks like a
	gratuitous RARP, just with the wrong protocol ID, which should be
	0x8035. I wrote some filters to let either one of the packets pass and
	am adapting the clean-traffic sample filter to use it. I am also
	doing some changes on the existing ARP filter which was lacking a
	test for source MAC address.

	nwfilter: add support for RAPR protocol
	This patch adds support for the RARP protocol. This may be needed due to
	qemu sending out a RARP packet (at least that's what it seems to want to
	do even though the protocol id is wrong) when migration finishes and
	we'd need a rule to let the packets pass.

	Unfortunately my installation of ebtables does not understand -p RARP
	and also seems to otherwise depend on strings in /etc/ethertype
	translated to protocol identifiers. Therefore I need to pass -p 0x8035
	for RARP. To generally get rid of the dependency of that file I switch
	all so far supported protocols to use their protocol identifier in the
	-p parameter rather than the string.

	I am also extending the schema and added a test case.

	changes from v1 to v2:
	- added test case into patch

2010-04-27  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Ignore qemu STOP event when stopping CPUs
	With JSON qemu monitor, we get a STOP event from qemu whenever qemu
	stops guests CPUs. The downside of it is that vm->state is changed to
	PAUSED and a new generic paused event is send to applications. However,
	when we ask qemu to stop the CPUs we are not really interested in qemu
	event and we usually want to issue a more specific event.

	By setting vm->status to PAUSED before actually sending the request to
	qemu (and resetting it back if the request fails) we can ignore the
	event since the event handler does nothing when the guest is already
	paused. This solution is quite hacky but unfortunately it's the best
	solution which I was able to come up with and it doesn't introduce a
	race condition.

	Fix build with DEBUG_RAW_IO=1

	Fix indentation for storage conf XML
	* virStorageEncryptionFormat is called from both

	  indentation for the storage XML.  This patch adopts Laine's

	Changes from V1 to V2:  - using INT_BUFSIZE_BOUND() to determine the length of the buffersize for printing and integer into
	 - not explicitly initializing static var threadsTerminate to false
	anymore, since that's done automatically

	Changes after V2:
	  - removed while looks in case of OOM error
	  - removed on ifaceDown() call
	  - preceding one ifaceDown() call with an ifaceCheck() call

	Since the name of an interface can be the same between stops and starts
	of different VMs I have to switch the IP address learning thread to use
	the index of the interface to determine whether an interface is still
	available or not - in the case of macvtap the thread needs to listen for
	traffic on the physical interface, thus having to time out periodically
	to check whether the VM's macvtap device is still there as an indication
	that the VM is still alive. Previously the following sequence of 2 VMs
	with macvtap device

	virsh start testvm1; virsh destroy testvm1 ; virsh start testvm2

	would not terminate the thread upon testvm1's destroy since the name of
	the interface on the host could be the same (i.e, macvtap0) on testvm1
	and testvm2, thus it was easily race-able. The thread would then
	determine the IP address parameter for testvm2 but apply the rule set
	for testvm1. :-(
	I am also introducing a lock for the interface (by name) that the thread
	must hold while it listens for the traffic and releases when it
	terminates upon VM termination or 0.5 second thereafter. Thus, the new
	thread for a newly started VM with the same interface name will not
	start while the old one still holds the lock. The only other code that I
	see that also needs to grab the lock to serialize operation is the one
	that tears down the firewall that were established on behalf of an
	interface.

	I am moving the code applying the 'basic' firewall rules during the IP
	address learning phase inside the thread but won't start the thread
	unless it is ensured that the firewall driver has the ability to apply
	the 'basic' firewall rules.

	Fix locking in qemudDomainCoreDump
	The hang fix in d376b7d63ec1ef24ba4c812d58b9a414ddb561f8 was incomplete
	since it left quite a few {Enter,Exit}Monitor calls which require driver
	to be unlocked. Since the driver is locked throughout the whole
	function, {Enter,Exit}MonitorWithDriver need to be used instead to
	ensure driver is not locked when issuing monitor commands.

	Poll for migration end every 50ms instead of 50us
	The comment in qemuDomainWaitForMigrationComplete says we are polling
	every 50ms but the code sleeps only for 50us. This was already discussed
	during review but apparently forgotten when the series was pushed.

	Fake host CPU for qemu tests

	Use configured CPU model if possible
	Adds ability to provide a preferred CPU model for CPUID data decoding.
	Such model would be considered as the best possible model (if it's
	supported by hypervisor) regardless on number of features which have to
	be added or removed for describing required CPU.

	Support removing features when converting data to CPU
	So far, when CPUID data were converted into CPU model and features, the
	features can only be added to the model. As a result, when a guest asked
	for something like "qemu64,-svm" it would get a qemu32 plus a bunch of
	additional features instead.

	This patch adds support for removing feature from the base model.
	Selection algorithm remains the same: the best CPU model is the model
	which requires lowest number of features to be added/removed from it.

	Move MIN macro to util.h so that others can use it

	Deal with CPU models in []
	Qemu committed a patch which list some CPU names in [] when asked for
	supported CPUs (qemu -cpu ?). Yet, it needs such CPUs to be passed
	without those square braces. When probing for supported CPU models, we
	can just strip the square braces and pretend we have never seen them.

	Fix initial VCPU pinning in qemu driver
	First, inital VCPU pinning is set correctly but then it is reset by
	assigning qemu process to a new cgroup (which contains all CPUs). It's
	easily fixed by swapping these two actions.

	Make avahi startup more robust.
	If the hostname of the current virtualization machine
	could not be resolved, then libvirtd would fail to
	start.  However, for disconnected operation (on a laptop,
	for instance) the hostname may very legitimately not
	be resolvable.  This patch makes it so that if we can't
	resolve the hostname, avahi doesn't fail, it just uses
	a less useful MDNS string.

	esx: Don't treat an empty root snapshot list as error
	An empty root snapshot list was considered as error condition. Creating a
	new snapshot would fail if the domain didn't have snapshots yet, because
	the snapshot-create function tries to lookup the list of existing snapshots
	in order to verify that the snapshot name is unique. This fails if the

	build: avoid compiler warning
	According to GCC, ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED means that an attribute _might_

	Install nwfilter xml files from source directory.
	During an out-of-tree build, the current working directory is the build
	directory. Since the FILTERS are static and not modified or
	auto-generated during the build process, they need to be explicitly
	fetched from the source directory during install.

	Prefix the files with $(srcdir), which gets expanded to the absolute or

	builds.

	Don't ship generated python/libvirt.? files.
	libvirt.c and libvirt.h are auto-generated files. Mentioning their names
	in *_SOURCES includes them in the distribution. During an out-of-tree
	build these shipped files are included instead of the auto-generated
	version, potentially breaking the build (as it happend in 0.8.0, because

	Use virCheckFlags for APIs added in 0.8.0

	Introduce virCheckFlags for consistent flags checking
	The idea is that every API implementation in driver which has flags
	parameter should first call virCheckFlags() macro to check the function
	was called with supported flags:

	    virCheckFlags(VIR_SUPPORTED_FLAG_1 |
	                  VIR_SUPPORTED_FLAG_2 |
	                  VIR_ANOTHER_SUPPORTED_FLAG, -1);

	The error massage which is printed when unsupported flags are passed
	looks like:

	    invalid argument in virFooBar: unsupported flags (0x2)

	Where the unsupported flags part only prints those flags which were
	passed but are not supported rather than all flags passed.

	Fix CDROM media change for QEMU when using -device syntax
	Disk devices in QEMU have two parts, the guest device and the host
	backend driver. Historically these two parts have had the same
	"unique" name. With the switch to using -device though, they now
	have separate names. Thus when changing CDROM media, for guests
	using -device syntax, we need to prepend the QEMU_DRIVE_HOST_PREFIX
	constant

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Add helper function
	  qemuDeviceDriveHostAlias() for building a host backend alias
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Use qemuDeviceDriveHostAlias() to determine
	  the host backend alias for performing eject/change commands in the
	  monitor

	Update QEMU device_add command in JSON mode
	The device_add command was added in JSON mode in a way I didn't
	expect. Instead of passing the normal device string to the JSON
	command:

	    { "execute": "device_add", "arguments": { "device": "ne2k_pci,id=nic.1,netdev=net.1" } }

	We need to split up the device string into a full JSON object

	    { "execute": "device_add", "arguments": { "driver": "ne2k_pci", "id": "nic.1", "netdev": "net.1" } }

	Rename parameter in qemuMonitorDeviceDel
	The parameter for the qemuMonitorDeviceDel() is a device alias,
	not a device config string. Rename the parameter reflect this

	  Rename devicestr to devalias in qemuMonitorDeviceDel()

	Remove code from JSON monitor for commands that won't be ported
	The QEMU developers have stated that they will not be porting
	the commands 'pci_add', 'pci_del', 'usb_add', 'usb_del' to the
	JSON mode monitor, since they're obsoleted by 'device_add'
	and 'device_del'. libvirt has (untested) code that would have
	supported those commands in theory, but since we already use
	device_add/del where available, there's no need to keep the
	legacy stuff anymore.

	The text mode monitor keeps support for all commands for sake
	of historical compatability.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c: Remove 'pci_add', 'pci_del',
	  'usb_add', 'usb_del' commands

	Run test suite as part of RPM build process
	To ensure that patches in the RPM don't break any functionality
	it is neccessary to run the test suites during build. It currently

	 - daemon-conf: this is totally broken, since it relies on
	   being able to resolve the 'libvirt' group & being able to
	   resolve hostnames at daemon startup. This isn't possible
	   in a mock build root
	 - seclabeltest: fails to initialize selinux in the mock
	   build root. Possibly fixable

	nwfilter: fix tear down order and consolidate functions
	To avoid race-conditions, the tear down of a filter has to happen before

	nwfilter: use virFindFileInPath for needed CLI tools
	I am getting rid of determining the path to necessary CLI tools at
	compile time. Instead, now the firewall driver has an initialization
	function that uses virFindFileInPath() to determine the path to
	necessary CLI tools and a shutdown function to free allocated memory.
	The rest of the patch mostly deals with availability of the CLI tools
	and to not call certain code blocks if a tool is not available and that
	strings now have to be built slightly differently.

	nwfilter: fix for directionality of ICMP traffic
	Changes from V1 to V2 of this patch
	- I had reversed the logic thinking that icmp type 0 is a echo

	This patch enables the skipping of some of the ICMP traffic rules on the

	properly enables unidirectional pings:

	<filter name='testcase'>

	    <!-- allow outgoing ICMP Echo Reply -->
	    <rule action='accept' direction='out' priority='500'>
	        <icmp type='0'/>
	    </rule>
	    <!-- drop all other ICMP traffic -->

	Executable does not belong into repository.
	Removing the tests/nwfilterxml2xmltest executable that got in with a previous patch.

	nwfilter: Support for learning a VM's IP address
	This patch implements support for learning a VM's IP address. It uses
	the pcap library to listen on the VM's backend network interface (tap)
	or the physical ethernet device (macvtap) and tries to capture packets
	with source or destination MAC address of the VM and learn from DHCP
	Offers, ARP traffic, or first-sent IPv4 packet what the IP address of
	the VM's interface is. This then allows to instantiate the network
	traffic filtering rules without the user having to provide the IP
	parameter somewhere in the filter description or in the interface
	description as a parameter. This only supports to detect the parameter
	IP, which is for the assumed single IPv4 address of a VM. There is not
	support for interfaces that may have multiple  IP addresses (IP
	aliasing) or IPv6 that may then require more than one valid IP address
	to be detected. A VM can have multiple independent interfaces that each
	uses a different IP address and in that case it will be attempted to
	detect each one of the address independently.

	So, when for example an interface description in the domain XML has
	looked like this up to now:

	    <interface type='bridge'>
	      <source bridge='mybridge'/>
	      <model type='virtio'/>
	      <filterref filter='clean-traffic'>
	        <parameter name='IP' value='10.2.3.4'/>
	      </filterref>
	    </interface>

	you may omit the IP parameter:

	    <interface type='bridge'>
	      <source bridge='mybridge'/>
	      <model type='virtio'/>
	      <filterref filter='clean-traffic'/>
	    </interface>

	Internally I am walking the 'tree' of a VM's referenced network filters
	and determine with the given variables which variables are missing. Now,
	the above IP parameter may be missing and this causes a libvirt-internal
	thread to be started that uses the pcap library's API to listen to the
	backend interface  (in case of macvtap to the physical interface) in an
	attempt to determine the missing IP parameter. If the backend interface
	disappears the thread terminates assuming the VM was brought down. In
	case of a macvtap device a timeout is being used to wait for packets
	from the given VM (filtering by VM's interface MAC address). If the VM's
	macvtap device disappeared the thread also terminates. In all other
	cases it tries to determine the IP address of the VM and will then apply
	the rules late on the given interface, which would have happened
	immediately if the IP parameter had been explicitly given. In case an
	error happens while the firewall rules are applied, the VM's backend
	interface is 'down'ed preventing it to communicate. Reasons for failure
	for applying the network firewall rules may that an ebtables/iptables
	command failes or OOM errors. Essentially the same failure reasons may
	occur as when the firewall rules are applied immediately on VM start,
	except that due to the late application of the filtering rules the VM
	now is already running and cannot be hindered anymore from starting.
	Bringing down the whole VM would probably be considered too drastic.
	While a VM's IP address is attempted to be determined only limited
	updates to network filters are allowed. In particular it is prevented
	that filters are modified in such a way that they would introduce new
	variables.

	A caveat: The algorithm does not know which one is the appropriate IP
	address of a VM. If the VM spoofs an IP address in its first ARP traffic
	or IPv4 packets its filtering rules will be instantiated for this IP
	address, thus 'locking' it to the found IP address. So, it's still
	'safer' to explicitly provide the IP address of a VM's interface in the
	filter description if it is known beforehand.

	The following rule in direction 'inout'

	<rule direction='inout' action='drop'>
	  <mac srcmacaddr='1:2:3:4:5:6'/>
	</rule>

	now drops all traffic from and to the given MAC address.
	So far it would have dropped traffic from the given MAC address
	and outgoing traffic with the given source MAC address, which is not useful
	since the packets will always have the VM's MAC address as source
	MAC address. The attached patch fixes this.

	This is the last bug I currently know of and want to fix.

	virsh: improve documentation
	Document several missing commands.  There's more work that could be

	* tools/virsh.pod (autostart, connect): Improve grammar.

	Clarify an error message in setmem.

	Fix up comments for isEncrypted, isSecure, domainIsActive, and domainIsPersistent.

	Document snapshot virsh commands in the man page.

	Better error reporting in virsh.
	When hitting failures in virsh, a common idiom is
	to jump to a cleanup label, free some resources, and
	then return a FALSE error code to vshCommandRun.
	In theory, vshCommandRun is then supposed to print
	out the last error.  The problem is that many of
	the cleanup paths have library calls to free resources,
	and all of those library calls clear out the last error.
	This is leading to situations where no error is being
	reported at all.

	This patch remedies the situation somewhat by
	printing out the errors inside the command methods
	themselves when we know it will go through a cleanup
	path that will lose the error.

	Website documentation for the snapshot XML.

	Increase the number of available VNC ports.
	When starting up qemu VNC autoport guests, we were
	only looking through ports 5900 to 6000, meaning we
	were limited to 100 total clients.  Increase that
	limit to 65535 (the last available port), so we can
	have up to 59635 VNC autoport guests.

	While playing around with def/newDef with the qemu code,

	is the virDomainLoadConfig is always doing virDomainAssignDef
	regardless of whether the domain already exists in the hashtable.
	In turn, virDomainAssignDef is assigning the definition (which
	is actually a duplicate) to newDef.  Fix this so that newDef stays

2010-04-04  Daniel Veillard  <veillard@redhat.com>

	Add a managedsave command to virsh
	This command implements the managed save operation

	* tools/virsh.c: new command
	* tools/virsh.pod: documentation

	Implement managed save operations for qemu driver
	The images are saved in /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save/
	and named $domainname.save . The directory is created appropriately
	at daemon startup. When a domain is started while a saved image is
	available, libvirt will try to load this saved image, and start the
	domain as usual in case of failure. In any case the saved image is
	discarded once the domain is created.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: adds an extra save path to the driver config
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: implement the 3 new operations and handling
	  of the image directory

	Implement remote protocol for managed save
	* src/remote/remote_protocol.x src/remote/remote_protocol.h
	  src/remote/remote_protocol.c src/remote/remote_driver.c: add the entry
	  points in the remote driver
	* daemon/remote.c daemon/remote_dispatch_args.h
	  daemon/remote_dispatch_prototypes.h daemon/remote_dispatch_table.h:
	  and implement the daemon counterpart

	Add managed save API entry points
	virDomainManagedSave() is to be run on a running domain. Once the call
	complete, as in virDomainSave() the domain is stopped upon completion,
	but there is no restore counterpart as any order to start the domain
	from the API would load the state from the managed file, similary if
	the domain is autostarted when libvirtd starts.
	Once a domain has restarted his managed save image is destroyed,
	basically managed save image can only exist for a stopped domain,
	for a running domain that would be by definition outdated data.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in src/libvirt.c src/libvirt_public.syms:
	  adds the new entry points virDomainManagedSave(),
	  virDomainHasManagedSaveImage() and virDomainManagedSaveRemove()

	build: improve check for out-of-date .gnulib submodule
	git reset --hard 96e5a2d4d5b13bf2cc887562dc11d146b78d5950
	./autogen.sh
	make -s
	git pull
	make -s    <-- expecting auto-bootstrap here, doesn't happen

	Use git diff to expose whether the submodule has untracked changes,
	which are typical on an incremental pull if .gnulib was updated but
	the user did not manually run 'git submodule update'.

	After this patch is applied, I encountered a new problem when
	following the reproducing pattern.  Basically, the change to .gnulib
	between libvirt's commit 96e5a2d4 and this patch introduced a change
	to sys_ioctl.in.h, but gnulib (intentionally) does not make the
	replacement headers depend on Makefile changes.  Therefore, I ended up
	with the generated replacement header being broken:
	gnulib/lib/sys/ioctl.h complained about a use of @.  But that seems
	like something that should be fixed upstream in gnulib's bootstrap
	script (that is, when doing a gnulib update, all files created from
	.in.h file should probably be deleted).  Without the benefit of that
	proposed gnulib fix, I worked around the problem by manually removing
	the stale gnulib/lib/sys/ioctl.h.

	* autogen.sh (t): Also run bootstrap if the gnulib submodule needs
	to be updated.
	* cfg.mk (_autogen): Likewise.
	Reported by Matthias Bolte.

	Use the virStrToLong_ui() function rather than the virStrToLong_i() where possible.

	The attached patch optimizes the validation of the name of an interface.

	This patch adds a couple of test cases for the XML parsing test suite covering various filterable protocols. For each test case an input XML and an output XML is provided checking the input XML after parsing and converting back into XML against the exepcted output XML.

	The following issues are fixed in the patch below:
	- ebtables requires that some of the command line parameters are passed as hex numbers; so have those attributes call a function that prints 16 and 8 bit integers as hex nunbers.

	- ip6tables requires '--icmpv6-type' rather than '--icmp-type'

	- ebtables complains about protocol identifiers lower than 0x600, so already discard anything lower than 0x600 in the parser

	- make the protocol entry types more readable using a #define for its entries

	- continue parsing a filtering rule even if a faulty entry is encountered; return an error value at the end and let the caller decide what to do with the rule's object

	- fix an error message

2010-04-02  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Changes to clock timer XML to match final design.
	The clock timer XML is being updated in the following ways (based on
	further off-list discussion that was missed during the initial
	implementation):

	1) 'wallclock' is changed to 'track', and the possible values are 'boot'
	 (corresponds to old 'host'), 'guest', and 'wall'.

	2) 'mode' has an additional value 'smpsafe'

	3) when tickpolicy='catchup', there can be an optional sub-element of
	   timer called 'catchup':

	   <catchup threshold=123 slew=120 limit=10000/>

	Those three values are all longs, always optional, and if they are present,
	they are positive. Internally, 0 indicates "unspecified".

	* docs/schemas/domain.rng: updated RNG definition to account for changes

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h: change the C struct and enums to match changes.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c: timer parse and format functions changed to
	                          handle the new selections and new element.

	* src/libvirt_private.syms: *TimerWallclock* changes to *TimerTrack*

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: again, account for Wallclock --> Track change.

	Allow domain disk images on root-squash NFS to coexist with security driver.
	(suggested by Daniel Berrange, tested by Dan Kenigsberg)

	virStorageFileGetMetadata will fail for disk images that are stored on
	a root-squash NFS share that isn't world-readable.
	SELinuxSetSecurityImageLabel is called during the startup of every
	domain (as long as security_driver != "none"), and it will propogate
	the error from virStorageFileGetMetadata, causing the domain startup
	to fail. This is, however, a common scenario when qemu is run as a
	non-root user and the disk image is stored on NFS.

	Ignoring this failure (which doesn't matter in this case, since the
	next thing done by SELinuxSetSecurityImageLabel - setting the file
	context - will also fail (and that function already ignores failures
	due to root-squash NFS) will allow us to continue bringing up the
	domain. The result is that we don't need to disable the entire
	security driver just because a domain's disk image is stored on
	root-squashed NFS.

	Eliminate compile warnings in nwfilter error log calls

2010-04-02  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Don't use virFileReadLimFD in qemuDomainRestore.
	virFileReadLimFD is a poor fit for reading the header
	of the restore file.  The problem is that virFileReadLimFD
	returns an error when there is more data after the amount
	you ask to read, but that is *expected* in this case.

	This patch is essentially a revert of
	1a4d5c9543641c444dccd682f6256ee3faf22a80, but I don't think
	that commit does what it says anyway.  It purports to prevent
	an unwarranted OOM error, but since virFileReadLimFD will
	allocate memory up to the maximum anyway, the upper limit
	on the total amount of memory allocated is the same for either
	the old version or the new version.  Since the old saferead
	actually works and virFileReadLimFD does not, revert to
	using saferead.

	Keep track of guest paused state after disk IO / watchdog events
	When a watchdog/IO error occurs, one of the possible actions that
	QEMU might take is to pause the guest. In this scenario libvirt
	needs to update its internal state for the VM, and emit a
	lifecycle event:

	  VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_SUSPENDED

	with a detail being one of:

	  VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_SUSPENDED_IOERROR
	  VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_SUSPENDED_WATCHDOG

	To future proof against possible QEMU support for multiple monitor
	consoles, this patch also hooks into the 'STOPPED' event in QEMU
	and emits a generic VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_SUSPENDED_PAUSED event

	Replace sscanf in PCI device address parsing
	This also fixes a problem with MinGW's GCC on Windows. GCC complains

	Now an error is reported for such a string.

	cgroup: Replace sscanf with virStrToLong_ll
	The switch from %lli to %lld in virCgroupGetValueI64 is intended,
	as virCgroupGetValueU64 uses base 10 too, and virCgroupSetValueI64
	uses %lld to format the number to string.

	Parsing is stricter now and doesn't accept trailing characters
	after the actual value anymore.

	Refactor major.minor.micro version parsing into a function
	virParseVersionString uses virStrToLong_ui instead of sscanf.

2010-04-01  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@us.ibm.com>

	While writing a couple of test cases for the nwfilter's XML parser I found some cases where the output ended up not looking as expected. So the following changes are in the patch below:
	- if the protocol ID in the MAC header is an integer, just write it into
	the datastructure without trying to find a corresponding string for it
	and if none is found failing
	- when writing the protocol ID as string, simply write it as integer if
	no corresponding string can be found
	- same changes for arpOpcode parsing and printing
	- same changes for protocol ID in an IP packet
	- DSCP value needs to be written into the data structure
	- IP protocol version number is redundant at this level, so remove it
	- parse the protocol ID found inside an IP packet not only as string but
	also as uint8
	- arrange the display of the src and destination masks to be shown after
	the src and destination ip address respectively in the XML
	- the existing libvirt IP address parser accepts for example '25' as an
	IP address. I want this to be parsed as a CIDR type netmask. So try to
	parse it as an integer first (CIDR netmask) and if that doesn't work as
	a dotted IP address style netmask.
	- instantiation of rules with MAC masks didn't work because they weren't
	printed into a buffer, yet.

	ESX test case needs '/' in interface name
	To fix an ESX test case, valid interface names need '/' as valid letter.

	This patch changes the network filtering code to use libvirt's existing
	IPv4 and IPv6 address parsers/printers rather than my self-written ones.

	I am introducing a new function in network.c that counts the number of
	bits in a netmask and ensures that the given address is indeed a netmask,
	return -1 on error or values of 0-32 for IPv4 addresses and 0-128 for
	IPv6 addresses. I then based the function checking for valid netmask
	on invoking this function.

	Add ip6tables support for IPv6 filtering
	This patch adds IPv6 filtering support for the following protocols:
	- tcp-ipv6
	- udp-ipv6
	- udplite-ipv6
	- esp-ipv6
	- ah-ipv6
	- sctp-ipv6
	- all-ipv6
	- icmpv6

	Many of the IPv4 data structure could be re-used for IPv6 support.
	Since ip6tables also supports pretty much the same command line parameters
	as iptables does, also much of the code could be re-used and now
	command lines are invoked with the ip(6)tables tool parameter passed
	through the functions as a parameter.

	Remove driver dependency from nwfilter_conf.c
	This patch removes the driver dependency from nwfilter_conf.c and moves
	a callback function calling into the driver into
	nwfilter_gentech_driver.c and passes a pointer to that callback function
	upon initialization of nwfilter_conf.c.

	Add support for so-far missing protocols for iptables filtering
	This patch adds filtering support for the so-far missing protocols 'ah',
	'esp' and 'udplite'.

	  return value is negative

	Implement the qemu-kvm backend of clock timer elements
	Since the timers are defined to cover all possible config cases for
	several different hypervisors, many of these possibilities generate an
	error on qemu. Here is what is currently supported:

	RTC: If the -rtc commandline option is available, allow setting
	"clock=host"
	     or "clock=vm" based on the rtc timer clock='host|guest' value. Also
	     add "driftfix=slew" if the tickpolicy is 'catchup', or add nothing
	if
	     tickpolicy is 'delay'. (Other tickpolicies will raise an error).

	     If -rtc isn't available, but -rtc-td-hack is, add that option
	     if the tickpolicy is 'catchup', add -rtc-td-hack, if it is 'delay'
	     add nothing, and if it's anything else, raise an error.

	PIT: If -no-kvm-pit-reinjection is available, and tickpolicy is
	     'delay', add that option. if tickpolicy is 'catchup', do
	     nothing. Anything else --> raise an error.

	     If -no-kvm-pit-reinjection *isn't* available, but -tdf is, when
	     tickpolicy is 'catchup' add -tdf. If it's 'delay', do
	     nothing. Anything else --> raise an error.

	     If neither of those commandline options is available, and
	     tickpolicy is anything other than 'delay' (or unspecified), raise
	     an error.

	HPET: If -no-hpet flag is available and present='no', add -no-hpet.
	      If -no-hpet is not available, and present='yes', raise an error.
	      If present is unspecified, the default is to do whatever this
	      particular qemu does by default, so don't raise an error.

	All other timer types are unsupported by QEMU, so they will raise an
	error.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: extend qemuBuildClockArgStr() to generate the
	  command line arguments for the new options

	Add flags to indicate presence of timekeeping-related qemu options
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: define 4 new flags
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: check the help text of qemu for presence of
	                        features indicated by each flag.
	* tests/qemuhelptest.c: add appropriate flags into the masks for each test

	Add timer element to domain schema
	timers are sub-elements of clocks. A clock can have zero or more
	instances of timer. Within the timer, only the name attribute is
	required; all other attributes are optional.

	A simpler representation of a timer element is:

	  <timer name='platform|pit|rtc|hpet|tsc'
	         wallclock='host|guest'
	         tickpolicy='delay|catchup|merge|discard'
	         frequency='123'
	         mode='auto|native|emulate|paravirt'
	         present='yes|no'/>

	frequency is a ulong. All other attributes are simple enums.

	Implement XML parser/formatter for "timer" subelement of domain clock
	This extension is described in

	http://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2010-March/msg00304.html

	Currently all attributes are optional, except name.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h: add data definition for virDomainTimerDef
	  and add a list of them to virDomainClockDef
	* src/conf/domain_conf.c: XML parser and formatter for a timer inside a clock
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: add new Timer enum helper functions to symbols

	Fix QEMU cpu affinity at startup to include all threads
	The QEMU cpu affinity is used in NUMA scenarios to ensure that
	guest memory is allocated from a specific node. Normally memory
	is allocate on demand in vCPU threads, but when using hugepages
	the initial thread leader allocates memory upfront. libvirt was
	not setting affinity of the thread leader, or I/O threads. This
	patch changes the code to set the process affinity in between
	the fork()/exec() of QEMU. This ensures that every single QEMU
	thread gets the affinity

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Set affinity on entire QEMU process
	  at startup

	virsh: support VISUAL, and allow metacharacters in EDITOR
	Common Unix practice is to prefer VISUAL over EDITOR, particularly if
	the editor of choice spawns a new window.  Thus, it is also common to
	see settings like EDITOR='emacs -nw', with the expectation that the
	shell will parse this as an argument to 'emacs' and not try to invoke
	a file containing a space.

	If a user puts junk in EDITOR, they deserve what they get (much more
	than virsh will misbehave); furthermore, sudo scrubs EDITOR by
	default.  So the blind use of metacharacters in EDITOR should not be
	considered too much of a security issue.

	* tools/virsh.c (editFile): Prefer VISUAL over EDITOR.  Don't
	reject shell metacharacters in EDITOR.
	* tools/virsh.pod (edit, net-edit, ENVIRONMENT): Document VISUAL.
	Fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=487738.

	Add dummy nwfilter driver to test driver
	This patch adds a dummy nwfilter driver to the test driver so that the
	int-overflow test passes without modifications.

	Fix "make check" run requesting authentication
	This patch fixes the 'make check' runs for me which, under certain
	circumstances and login configurations, did invoke popups requesting
	authentication. I removed the parameter conn from being passed into the
	error reporting function.

	* src/conf/nwfilter_conf.h src/conf/nwfilter_conf.c: remove conn from
	  error reporting parameters.

	Fix a merge error leftover

	Add script hook support to the LXC driver
	Right now this implements only 2 basic hooks:
	- before the lxc control process is being launched
	- after the lxc control process is terminated
	the XML description of the domain is passed to the hook script stdin
	/etc/libvirt/hook/lxc

	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c: implement synchronous script hooks for LXC
	  at domain startup and end

	Add script hook support to the QEmu driver
	Right now this implements only 2 basic hooks:
	- before the qemu process is being launched
	- after the qemu process is terminated
	the XML description of the domain is passed to the hook script stdin
	/etc/libvirt/hook/qemu

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: implement synchronous script hooks for QEmu
	  at domain startup and end

	Add the script hook support to the libvirt daemon
	It supports 3 kind of probing times, at daemon startup, when the
	daemon reloads its drivers on SIGHUP and when the daemon exits

	* daemon/libvirtd.c: daemon hooks for startup, reload and exit

	Add hook utilities
	This exports 3 basic routines:
	  - virHookInitialize() initializing the hook support by looking for
	    scripts availability
	  - virHookPresent() used to test if there is a hook for a given driver
	  - virHookCall() which actually calls a synchronous script hook with
	    the needed parameters
	Note that this doesn't expose any public API except for the locations
	and arguments passed to the scripts

	* src/Makefile.am: add the 2 new files
	* src/util/hooks.h src/util/hooks.c: implements the 3 functions
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: export the 3 symbols internally
	* po/POTFILES.in: add src/util/hooks.c to translatables modules

	Add an error module and message for the hooks subsystem
	* include/libvirt/virterror.h: add VIR_FROM_HOOK and VIR_ERR_HOOK_SCRIPT_FAILED
	* src/util/virterror.c: associated strings

	Export virPipeReadUntilEOF internally
	used to read the data from virExec stdout/err file descriptors

	* src/util/util.c src/util/util.h: not static anymore and export it
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: allow access internally

	Introduce UPDATE_CPU flag for virDomainGetXMLDesc
	This flag is used in migration prepare step to send updated XML
	definition of a guest.

	Also ``virsh dumpxml --update-cpu [--inactive] guest'' command can be
	used to see the updated CPU requirements.

	Helper function for making a copy of virCPUDefPtr

	cpuUpdate() for updating guest CPU according to host CPU
	Useful mainly for migration. cpuUpdate changes guest CPU requirements in
	the following way:

	- match == "strict" || match == "exact"
	    - optional features which are supported by host CPU are changed into
	      required features
	    - optional features which are not supported by host CPU are disabled
	    - all other features remain untouched
	- match == "minimum"
	    - match is changed into "exact"
	    - optional features and all features not mentioned in guest CPU
	      specification which are supported by host CPU become required
	      features
	    - other optional features are disabled
	    - all other features remain untouched

	This ensures that no feature will suddenly disappear from the guest
	after migration.

	Don't replace persistent domain config with migrated config
	When a domain is defined on host1, migrated to host2 and then migrated
	back to host1, its current configuration would overwrite the libvirtd's
	in-memory copy of persistent configuration of that domain. This is not
	desired as we want to preserve the persistent configuration untouched.

	This patch introduces new 'live' parameter to virDomainAssignDef.
	Passing 'true' for 'live' means the configuration passed to
	virDomainAssignDef describes a configuration of live instance of the
	domain. This applies for saved domains which are being restored or for
	incoming domains during migration.

	All callers have been changed to pass the appropriate value.

	Add some examples filters
	This patch adds some example filters to libvirt. They are automatically
	installed into the proper directory for libvirt to pick them up.

	Extensions for iptables rules
	This patch adds support for L3/L4 filtering using iptables. This adds
	support for 'tcp', 'udp', 'icmp', 'igmp', 'sctp' etc. filtering.

	As mentioned in the introduction, a .c file provided by this patch
	is #include'd into a .c file. This will need work, but should be alright
	for review.

	Add IPv6 support for the ebtables layer
	This patch adds IPv6 support for the ebtables layer. Since the parser
	etc. are all parameterized, it was fairly easy to add this...

	Add qemu support
	Add support for Qemu to have firewall rules applied and removed on VM
	startup and shutdown respectively. This  patch also provides support for
	the updating of a filter that causes all VMs that reference the filter
	to have their ebtables/iptables rules updated.

	Core driver implementation with ebtables support
	This patch implements the core driver and provides
	- management functionality for managing the filter XMLs
	- compiling the internal filter representation into ebtables rules
	- applying ebtables rules on a network (tap,macvtap) interface
	- tearing down ebtables rules that were applied on behalf of an
	interface
	- updating of filters while VMs are running and causing the firewalls to
	be rebuilt
	- other bits and pieces

	Add XML parser extensions for network filtering
	This patch adds XML processing for the network filter schema
	and extends the domain XML processing to parse the top level
	referenced filter along with potentially provided parameters

	Add virsh support for new CLI commands
	This patch adds virsh support for the five new CLI commands to manage
	network filters.

	Definition of the wire format, RPC client & server
	This patch adds the definition of the wire format for RPC calls
	and implementation of the RPC client & server code

	Implementation of the public API
	This patch adds the implementation of the public API for the network
	filtering (ACL) extensions to libvirt.c .

	Add internal API
	This patch adds the internal API extensions for network filtering (ACL) support.

	Add public API
	This patch adds extensions to libvirt's public API necessary for
	controlling the new functionality from remote for example.

	Add recursive locks
	This patch adds recursive locks necessary due to the processing of
	network filter XML that can reference other network filters, including
	references that cause looks. Loops in the XML are prevented but their
	detection requires recursive locks.

	Use enum of virDomainNetType
	To find out where the net type 'direct' needs to be handled I introduced
	the 'enum virDomainNetType' in the virDomainNetDef structure and let the
	compiler tell me where the case statement is missing. Then I added the
	unhandled device statement to the UML driver.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h: change _virDomainNetDef type from int to
	  virDomainNetType enum
	* src/conf/domain_conf.c src/lxc/lxc_driver.c src/qemu/qemu_conf.c

	Implement VNC password change in QEMU
	Use the new virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags API to allow the VNC password
	to be changed on the fly

	* src/internal.h: Define STREQ_NULLABLE() which is like STREQ()
	  but does not crash if either argument is NULL, and treats two
	  NULLs as equal.
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Export virDomainGraphicsTypeToString
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Support VNC password change on a live
	  machine
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c: Disable crazy debugging info. Treat a
	  NULL password as "" (empty string), allowing passwords to be
	  disabled in the monitor

	Allow parsing <graphics> in device XML
	Expand the parser for the standalone <device> XML format to
	allow inclusion of the <graphics> device type

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h: Add virDomainGraphicsDef to
	  the virDomainDeviceDef struct
	* src/conf/domain_conf.c: Wire up parser for virDomainGraphicsDef
	  to virDomainDeviceDefParse method

	Introduce a update-device command in virsh
	Support the new virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags API in virsh by adding
	a new 'update-device' command. In the future this should be augmented
	with an explicit 'change-disk' command for media change to make it
	end user discoverable, as attach-disk is.

	* tools/virsh.c: Add 'update-device' command

	Implement virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags API in all drivers with media change
	To allow the new virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags() API to be universally
	used with all drivers, this patch adds an impl to all the current
	drivers which support CDROM or Floppy disk media change via the
	current virDomainAttachDeviceFlags API

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c, src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c,
	  src/xen/proxy_internal.c, src/xen/xen_driver.c,
	  src/xen/xend_internal.c: Implement media change via the
	  virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags API
	* src/xen/xen_driver.h, src/xen/xen_hypervisor.c,
	  src/xen/xen_inotify.c, src/xen/xm_internal.c,
	  src/xen/xs_internal.c: Stubs for Xen driver entry points

	Remote protocol impl for virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags
	This defines the wire format for the new virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags()
	API, and implements the server & client side of the marshalling code.

	* daemon/remote.c: Server side dispatch for virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags
	* src/remote/remote_driver.c: Client side serialization for
	  virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags
	* src/remote/remote_protocol.x: Define wire format for

	* daemon/remote_dispatch_args.h, daemon/remote_dispatch_prototypes.h,
	  daemon/remote_dispatch_table.h, src/remote/remote_protocol.c,
	  src/remote/remote_protocol.h: Re-generate code

	Introduce a new virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags public API
	The current virDomainAttachDevice API can be (ab)used to change
	the media of an existing CDROM/Floppy device. Going forward there
	will be more devices that can be configured on the fly and overloading
	virDomainAttachDevice for this is not too pleasant. This patch adds
	a new virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags() explicitly just for modifying
	existing devices.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in: Add virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags
	* src/driver.h: Internal API for virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags
	* src/libvirt.c, src/libvirt_public.syms: Glue public API to
	  driver API
	* src/esx/esx_driver.c, src/lxc/lxc_driver.c, src/opennebula/one_driver.c,

	  src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c, src/xen/xen_driver.c, src/xenapi/xenapi_driver.c: Add
	  stubs for new driver entry point

	Add domain events for graphics network clients
	This introduces a new event type

	   VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_GRAPHICS

	The same event can be emitted in 3 scenarios

	  typedef enum {
	      VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_GRAPHICS_CONNECT = 0,
	      VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_GRAPHICS_INITIALIZE,
	      VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_GRAPHICS_DISCONNECT,
	  } virDomainEventGraphicsPhase;

	Connect/disconnect are triggered at socket accept/close.
	The initialize phase is immediately after the protocol
	setup and authentication has completed. ie when the
	client is authorized and about to start interacting with
	the graphical desktop

	This event comes with *a lot* of potential information

	 - IP address, port & address family of client
	 - IP address, port & address family of server
	 - Authentication scheme (arbitrary string)
	 - Authenticated subject identity. A subject may have
	   multiple identities with some authentication schemes.
	   For example, vencrypt+sasl results in a x509dname
	   and saslUsername identities.

	This results in a very complicated callback :-(

	   typedef enum {
	      VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_GRAPHICS_ADDRESS_IPV4,
	      VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_GRAPHICS_ADDRESS_IPV6,
	   } virDomainEventGraphicsAddressType;

	   struct _virDomainEventGraphicsAddress {
	       int family;
	       const char *node;
	       const char *service;
	   };
	   typedef struct _virDomainEventGraphicsAddress virDomainEventGraphicsAddress;
	   typedef virDomainEventGraphicsAddress *virDomainEventGraphicsAddressPtr;

	   struct _virDomainEventGraphicsSubject {
	      int nidentity;
	      struct {
	          const char *type;
	          const char *name;
	      } *identities;
	   };
	   typedef struct _virDomainEventGraphicsSubject virDomainEventGraphicsSubject;
	   typedef virDomainEventGraphicsSubject *virDomainEventGraphicsSubjectPtr;

	   typedef void (*virConnectDomainEventGraphicsCallback)(virConnectPtr conn,
	                                                         virDomainPtr dom,
	                                                         int phase,
	                                                         virDomainEventGraphicsAddressPtr local,
	                                                         virDomainEventGraphicsAddressPtr remote,
	                                                         const char *authScheme,
	                                                         virDomainEventGraphicsSubjectPtr subject,
	                                                         void *opaque);

	The wire protocol is similarly complex

	   struct remote_domain_event_graphics_address {
	     int family;
	     remote_nonnull_string node;
	     remote_nonnull_string service;
	   };

	   const REMOTE_DOMAIN_EVENT_GRAPHICS_IDENTITY_MAX = 20;

	   struct remote_domain_event_graphics_identity {
	     remote_nonnull_string type;
	     remote_nonnull_string name;
	   };

	   struct remote_domain_event_graphics_msg {
	     remote_nonnull_domain dom;
	     int phase;
	     remote_domain_event_graphics_address local;
	     remote_domain_event_graphics_address remote;
	     remote_nonnull_string authScheme;
	     remote_domain_event_graphics_identity subject<REMOTE_DOMAIN_EVENT_GRAPHICS_IDENTITY_MAX>;
	   };

	protocol, but designed to be usable with SPICE graphics in
	the future too.

	In addition it has the source path of the disk that had the

	Add support for an explicit  RTC change event
	This introduces a new event type

	   VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_RTC_CHANGE

	This event includes the new UTC offset measured in seconds.
	Thus there is a new callback definition for this event type

	 typedef void (*virConnectDomainEventRTCChangeCallback)(virConnectPtr conn,
	                                                        virDomainPtr dom,

	If the guest XML configuration for the <clock> is set to

	Add support for an explicit guest reboot event
	The reboot event is not a normal lifecycle event, since the
	virtual machine on the host does not change state. Rather the
	guest OS is resetting the virtual CPUs. ie, the QEMU process
	does not restart. Thus, this does not belong in the current
	lifecycle events callback.

	This introduces a new event type

	    VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_REBOOT

	It takes no parameters, besides the virDomainPtr, so it can
	use the generic callback signature.

	Rename domain lifecycle event message
	To avoid confusion, rename the current REMOTE_PROC_DOMAIN_EVENT
	message to REMOTE_PROC_DOMAIN_EVENT_LIFECYCLE. This does not
	cause ABI problems, since the names are only relevant at the source
	code level. On the wire they encoding is a plain integer whose
	value does not change

	* src/remote/remote_protocol.x: Rename REMOTE_PROC_DOMAIN_EVENT
	  to REMOTE_PROC_DOMAIN_EVENT_LIFECYCLE.
	* daemon/remote.c, src/remote/remote_driver.c: Update code for
	  renamed event

	Convert domain events example to new API
	Convert the domain events example program to use the new
	events APIs for one of its callback registrations to demo the
	new API and interoperability with the old API.

	* examples/domain-events/events-c/event-test.c: Convert to
	  new events API

	Remote driver & daemon impl of new event API
	This wires up the remote driver to handle the new events APIs.
	The public API allows an application to request a callback filters
	events to a specific domain object, and register multiple callbacks
	for the same event type. On the wire there are two strategies for
	this

	 - Register multiple callbacks with the remote daemon, each
	   with filtering as needed
	 - Register only one callback per event type, with no filtering

	Both approaches have potential inefficiency. In the first scheme,
	the same event gets sent over the wire many times if multiple
	callbacks are registered. With the second scheme, unneccessary
	events get sent over the wire if a per-domain filter is set on
	the client. The second scheme is far easier to implement though,
	so this patch takes that approach.

	* daemon/dispatch.h: Don't export remoteRelayDomainEvent since it
	  is no longer needed for unregistering callbacks, instead the
	  unique callback ID is used
	* daemon/libvirtd.c, daemon/libvirtd.h: Track and unregister
	  callbacks based on callback ID, instead of function pointer
	* daemon/remote.c: Switch over to using virConnectDomainEventRegisterAny
	  instead of legacy virConnectDomainEventRegister function. Refactor
	  remoteDispatchDomainEventSend() to cope with arbitrary event types
	* src/driver.h, src/driver.c: Move verify() call into source file
	  instead of header, to avoid polluting the global namespace with
	  the verify function name
	* src/remote/remote_driver.c: Implement new APIs for event
	  registration. Refactor processCallDispatchMessage() to cope
	  with arbitrary incoming event types. Merge remoteDomainQueueEvent()
	  into processCallDispatchMessage() to avoid duplication of code.
	  Rename remoteDomainReadEvent() to remoteDomainReadEventLifecycle()
	* src/remote/remote_protocol.x: Define wire format for the new
	  virConnectDomainEventRegisterAny and virConnectDomainEventDeregisterAny
	  functions

	Support new event register/deregister APis in all drivers except remote
	The libvirtd daemon impl will need to switch over to using the
	new event APIs. To make this simpler, ensure all drivers currently
	providing events support both the new APIs and old APIs.

	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c, src/qemu/qemu_driver.c, src/test/test_driver.c,
	  src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c, src/xen/xen_driver.c: Implement the new
	  virConnectDomainEvent(Dereg|Reg)isterAny driver entry points

	Add new internal domain events APIs for handling other event types
	The current internal domain events API tracks callbacks based on
	the function pointer, and only supports lifecycle events. This
	adds new internal APIs for registering callbacks for other event
	types. These new APIs are postfixed with the word 'ID' to indicate
	that they operated based on event ID, instead of hardcoded to
	lifecycle events

	* src/conf/domain_event.c, src/conf/domain_event.h,
	  src/libvirt_private.syms: Add new APIs for handling callbacks
	  for non-lifecycle events

	Refactor domain events to handle multiple event types
	The internal domain events APIs are designed to handle the lifecycle
	events. This needs to be refactored to allow arbitrary new event
	types to be handled.

	 * The signature of virDomainEventDispatchFunc changes to use
	   virConnectDomainEventGenericCallback instead of the lifecycle
	   event specific virConnectDomainEventCallback
	 * Every registered callback gains a unique ID to allow its
	   removal based on ID, instead of function pointer
	 * Every registered callback gains an 'eventID' to allow callbacks
	   for different types of events to be distinguished
	 * virDomainEventDispatch is adapted to filter out callbacks
	   whose eventID does not match the eventID of the event being
	   dispatched
	 * virDomainEventDispatch is adapted to filter based on the
	   domain name and uuid, if this filter is set for a callback.
	 * virDomainEvent type/detail fields are moved into a union to
	   allow different data fields for other types of events to be
	   added later

	* src/conf/domain_event.h, src/conf/domain_event.c: Refactor
	  to allow handling of different types of events
	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c, src/qemu/qemu_driver.c,
	  src/remote/remote_driver.c, src/test/test_driver.c,
	  src/xen/xen_driver.c: Change dispatch function signature
	  to use virConnectDomainEventGenericCallback

	Make internal domain events struct definitions private
	The virtual box driver was directly accesing the domain events
	structs instead of using the APIs provided. To prevent this kind
	of abuse, make the struct definitions private, forcing use of the
	internal APIs. This requires adding one extra internal API.

	* src/conf/domain_event.h, src/conf/domain_event.c: Move
	  virDomainEventCallback and virDomainEvent structs into
	  the source file instead of header
	* src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c: Use official APIs for dispatching domain
	  events instead of accessing structs directly.

	Introduce a new public API for domain events
	The current API for domain events has a number of problems

	 - Only allows for domain lifecycle change events
	 - Does not allow the same callback to be registered multiple times
	 - Does not allow filtering of events to a specific domain

	This introduces a new more general purpose domain events API

	  typedef enum {
	     VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_LIFECYCLE = 0,       /* virConnectDomainEventCallback */
	      ...more events later..
	  }

	  int virConnectDomainEventRegisterAny(virConnectPtr conn,
	                                       virDomainPtr dom, /* Optional, to filter */
	                                       int eventID,
	                                       virConnectDomainEventGenericCallback cb,
	                                       void *opaque,
	                                       virFreeCallback freecb);

	  int virConnectDomainEventDeregisterAny(virConnectPtr conn,
	                                         int callbackID);

	Since different event types can received different data in the callback,
	the API is defined with a generic callback. Specific events will each
	have a custom signature for their callback. Thus when registering an
	event it is neccessary to cast the callback to the generic signature

	eg

	  int myDomainEventCallback(virConnectPtr conn,
	                            virDomainPtr dom,
	                            int event,
	                            int detail,
	                            void *opaque)
	  {
	    ...
	  }

	  virConnectDomainEventRegisterAny(conn, NULL,
	                                   VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_LIFECYCLE,
	                                   VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_CALLBACK(myDomainEventCallback)
	                                   NULL, NULL);

	to the generic signature

2010-03-24  Matthias Bolte  <matthias.bolte@googlemail.com>

	tests: Don't add extra padding if counter mod 40 is 0
	This change only affects the output of tests that have an exact
	multiple of 40 test cases. For example the domainschematest currently:

	TEST: domainschematest
	      ........................................ 40
	      ........................................ 80
	      ........................................ 120
	      ........................................ 160
	      ........................................                                         200 OK
	PASS: domainschematest

	It outputs additional 40 spaces on the last line.

	The domainschematest output is fixed by the change in test-lib.sh. The
	change in testutils.c fixes this for tests written in C. Currently no
	C test has an exact multiple of 40 test cases, but I checked it and
	the same problem exists there.

	This patch stops that in both cases.

	util: Add stubs for some functions on Windows
	virSetCloseExec and virExecDaemonize were missing a body on Windows.

	Add HAVE_PTHREAD_H guard for pthread_sigmask
	Correctly disable pthread related code if pthread is not avialable,
	in order to get it compile with MinGW on Windows.

	bootstrap: Enable copy-mode for MinGW builds
	MSYS' ln doesn't work well in the way bootstrap uses it with relative paths.

	util: Handle lack of (f)chmod and (f)chown on Windows
	Even if gnulib can provide stubs, it won't help that much. So just
	replace affected util functions (virFileOperation and virDirCreate)
	with stubs on Windows. Both functions aren't used on libvirt's
	client side, so this is fine for MinGW builds.

	bootstrap: Remove rsync from buildreq list
	rsync is used to download .po files, but SKIP_PO=true is set and
	downloading .po files is skipped.

	This also fixes a problem with MinGW builds, because rsync is not
	available for MinGW.

	util: Make some conditional symbols unconditional
	Add dummy bodies for HAVE_GETPWUID_R and HAVE_MNTENT_H dependent
	functions for MinGW builds.

	Make sure virtTestCaptureProgramOutput has a body on Windows
	Now the virsh tests compile at least.

	Fix export of virConnectAuthPtrDefault for MinGW builds
	Use the __declspec(dllexport/dllimport) stuff to export the symbol,
	otherwise accessing virConnectAuthPtrDefault triggers a segfault.

	Remove interfaceRegister from libvirt_private.syms
	This symbol is conditional, it would need to be exported conditional to
	work properly with MinGW. So just remove it, as no other driver register
	function is listed in the symbols files.

	Export conditional state driver symbols only when they are defined
	This is necessary for MinGW builds.

	Make sure uid_t and gid_t are available

	esx: Add esxVI_LookupVirtualMachineByName
	Used in esxDomainLookupByName and to be used in esxDomainDefineXML later.

	esx: Fix potential memory leak in esxVI_BuildFullTraversalSpecItem
	If esxVI_String_DeepCopyValue or esxVI_SelectionSpec_AppendToList fail
	then selectionSpec would leak. Add a free call in the failure path to
	fix the leak.

	esx: Cleanup file header comments
	Replace 'method' with 'function' and get the filename's suffix right.

	esx: Generate method mappings via macros
	This is actually a consequence of the reworked required parameter
	checking: Unify the required parameter check into a Validate function
	instead of doing it separately im the (de)serialization part.

	The required parameter checking for the mapped methods parameter was
	done in the (de)serialize functions before. Now it's explicitly done
	in the mapped method itself.

2010-03-17  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Allow suspend during live migration
	Currently no command can be sent to a qemu process while another job is
	active. This patch adds support for signaling long-running jobs (such as
	migration) so that other threads may request predefined operations to be
	done during such jobs. Two signals are defined so far:
	    - QEMU_JOB_SIGNAL_CANCEL
	    - QEMU_JOB_SIGNAL_SUSPEND

	The first one is used by qemuDomainAbortJob.

	The second one is used by qemudDomainSuspend for suspending a domain
	during migration, which allows for changing live migration into offline
	migration. However, there is a small issue in the way qemudDomainSuspend
	is currently implemented for migrating domains. The API calls returns
	immediately after signaling migration job which means it is asynchronous
	in this specific case.

	Make nodeGetInfo report the correct number of NUMA nodes.
	The nodeGetInfo code was always assuming that machine had a
	single NUMA node, which is not correct.  The good news is that
	libnuma gives us this information pretty easily, so let's
	properly report it.

	NOTE: With recent hardware starting to support CPU hot-add
	and hot-remove, both this code and the nodeCapsInitNUMA()
	code are quickly going to become obsolete.  We'll have to
	think of a more dynamic solution for dealing with NUMA

	Fix crash in virsh after bogus command
	If you ran virsh in interactive mode and ran a command

	at the end of vshCommandParse, but forgetting to
	set ctl->cmd to NULL.  This means that on the next command,
	we would try to free the same structure again, leading
	to badness.

	* tools/virsh.c: Make sure to set ctl->cmd to NULL after
	  freeing it in vshCommandParse()

	Fix hang in qemudDomainCoreDump.
	Currently if you dump the core of a qemu guest with
	qemudDomainCoreDump, subsequent commands will hang
	up libvirtd.  This is because qemudDomainCoreDump
	uses qemuDomainWaitForMigrationComplete, which expects
	the qemuDriverLock to be held when it's called.  This
	patch does the simple thing and moves the qemuDriveUnlock
	to the end of the qemudDomainCoreDump so that the driver
	lock is held for the entirety of the call (as it is done
	in qemudDomainSave).  We will probably want to make the
	lock more fine-grained than that in the future, but
	we can fix both qemudDomainCoreDump and qemudDomainSave
	at the same time.

	Make sure qemudDomainSetVcpus doesn't hang.
	The code to add job support into libvirtd caused a problem
	in qemudDomainSetVcpus.  In particular, a qemuDomainObjEndJob()
	call was added at the end of the function, but a
	corresponding qemuDomainObjBeginJob() was not.  Additionally,
	a call to qemuDomainObj{Enter,Exit}Monitor() was also missed
	in qemudDomainHotplugVcpus().  These missing calls conspired to
	cause a hang in the libvirtd process after the command was
	finished.  Fix this by adding the missing calls.

2010-03-11  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Remove qemudDomainSetMaxMemory.
	As previously discussed[1], this patch removes the
	qemudDomainSetMaxMemory() function, since it doesn't
	work.  This means that instead of getting somewhat
	cryptic errors, you will now get:

	error: Unable to change MaxMemorySize
	error: this function is not supported by the hypervisor: virDomainSetMaxMemory

	Which describes the situation perfectly.

	Fix a JSON CPU information bug.
	When using the JSON monitor, qemuMonitorJSONExtractCPUInfo

	it returns the correct number.  This makes "virsh vcpuinfo <domain>"
	work when using the JSON monitor.

	Get thread and socket information in virsh nodeinfo.
	The current code for "nodeinfo" is pretty naive
	about socket and thread information.  To determine the
	sockets, it just takes the number of cpus and divides
	by the number of cores.  For the thread count, it always
	sets it to 1.  With more recent Intel machines, however,
	hyperthreading is again an option, meaning that these
	heuristics no longer work and give bogus numbers.  This
	patch goes through /sys to get the additional
	information so we properly report it.

	Note that I had to edit the tests not to report on
	socket and thread counts, since these are determined
	dynamically now.

	Fix USB passthrough based on product/vendor
	Changeset

	  commit 5073aa994af460e775cb3e548528e28d7660fcc8
	  Author: Cole Robinson <crobinso@redhat.com>
	  Date:   Mon Jan 11 11:40:46 2010 -0500

	Added support for product/vendor based passthrough, but it only
	worked at the security driver layer. The main guest XML config
	was not updated with the resolved bus/device ID. When the QEMU
	argv refactoring removed use of product/vendor, this then broke
	launching guests.

	THe solution is to move the product/vendor resolution up a layer
	into the QEMU driver. So the first thing QEMU does is resolve
	the product/vendor to a bus/device and updates the XML config
	with this info. The rest of the code, including security drivers
	and QEMU argv generated can now rely on bus/device always being
	set.

	* src/util/hostusb.c, src/util/hostusb.h: Split vendor/product
	  resolution code out of usbGetDevice and into usbFindDevice.
	  Add accessors for bus/device ID
	* src/security/virt-aa-helper.c, src/security/security_selinux.c,
	  src/qemu/qemu_security_dac.c: Remove vendor/product from the
	  usbGetDevice() calls
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Use usbFindDevice to resolve vendor/product
	  into a bus/device ID

	Convert QEMU driver all hotunplug code from pci_del to device_del
	The pci_del command is not being ported to QMP. Convert all the
	QEMU hotplug code over to use device_del whenever it is available
	to avoid the pci_del problem

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Convert unplug code to device_del

	Support hot-unplug for USB devices in QEMU
	Previously hot-unplug could not be supported for USB devices
	in QEMU, since usb_del required the guest visible address
	which libvirt never knows. With 'device_del' command we can
	now unplug based on device alias, so support that.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Use device_del to remove USB devices

	Tweak container initialization to make upstart/init happier
	Upstart crashes & burns in a heap if $TERM environment variable
	is missing. Presumably the kernel always sets this when booting
	init on a real machine, so libvirt should set it for containers
	too.

	To make a typical inittab / mingetty setup happier, we need to
	symlink the primary console /dev/pts/0 to /dev/tty1.

	Improve logging in certain scenarios to make troubleshooting
	easier

	* src/lxc/lxc_container.c: Create /dev/tty1 and set $TERM

	Misc fixes for LXC cgroups setup
	When using the 'ns' cgroup controller, the moment a process calls
	'unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)', it will be given a private cgroup tree
	under its current location. This really messages up the LXC
	controller process, because it ends up creating the containers'
	cgroup in the wrong place. The fix is fairly easy, just move
	the cgroup setup before the code which calls unshare(). The
	'ns' controller will still create extra undesired cgroups, but
	they at least won't break libvirt's setup now.

	The patch also adds a missing cgroups allow rule for /dev/tty
	device node

	Avoid creating top level cgroups if just querying for existance
	When getting the driver/domain cgroup it is possible to specify
	whether it should be auto created. If auto-creation was turned
	off, libvirt still mistakenly created its own top level cgroup

	* src/util/cgroup.c: Honour autocreate flag for top level cgroup

	Change default for storage uid/gid from getuid()/getgid() to -1/-1
	This allows the config to have a setting that means "leave it alone",
	eg when building a pool where the directory already exists the user
	may want the current uid/gid of the directory left intact. This
	actually gets us back to older behavior - before recent changes to the
	pool building code, we weren't as insistent about honoring the uid/gid
	settings in the XML, and virt-manager was taking advantage of this
	behavior.

	As a side benefit, removing calls to getuid/getgid from the XML
	parsing functions also seems like a good idea. And having a default
	that is different from a common/useful value (0 == root) is a good
	thing in general, as it removes ambiguity from decisions (at least one
	place in the code was checking for (perms.uid == 0) to see if a
	special uid was requested).

	Note that this will only affect newly created pools and volumes. Due
	to the way that the XML is parsed, then formatted for newly created
	volumes, all existing pools/volumes already have an explicit uid and
	gid set.

	src/conf/storage_conf.c: Remove calls to setuid/setgid for default values
	                         of uid/gid, and set them to -1 instead

	src/storage/storage_backend.c:
	src/storage/storage_backend_fs.c:
	        Make account for the new default values of perms.uid
	        and perms.gid.

	build: vbox: avoid build failure when linking with --no-add-needed
	With the recent changes to the linking defaults in Fedora 13 (namely
	enabling --no-add-needed behaviour by default), we have to pass the
	dlopen()-providing libraries directly at the link of the module; use the
	same AC_SEARCH_LIBS function as used before to look for it and add it to
	the Makefile.

	build: avoid dlopen-related link failure on rawhide/F13
	Instead of using AC_CHECK_LIB and hardcoding -ldl, search for the library
	needed to get dlopen() and then use the cached value.

2010-03-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Support VCPU hotplug in QEMU guests
	QEMU has a monitor command 'set_cpu' which allows a specific
	CPU to be toggled between online& offline state. libvirt CPU
	hotplug does not work in terms of individual indexes CPUs.
	Thus to support this, we iteratively toggle the online state
	when the total number of vCPUs is adjusted via libvirt

	NB, currently untested since QEMU segvs when running this!

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Toggle online state for CPUs when
	  doing hotplug
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.h: Add
	  monitor API for toggling a CPU's online status via 'set_cpu

	Fix parser checking of storage pool device
	The storage backend implementations all presume that the XML parser
	is validating correctness of the source specification. The check for
	a source device was lost at some point. This allowed for a potential
	crash in the disk backend. Re-introduce the sanity check

	* src/conf/storage_conf.c: Re-add check for source device

	Fix mis-leading error message in pool delete API
	When trying to delete a pool the error message claimed the volume
	could not be deleted.

	* src/storage/storage_driver.c: Error message referred to
	  volumes instead of pools

	Fix typo in QEMU migration command name
	The QMP code was running query-migration instead of query-migrate.
	This doesn't work so well

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c: s/query-migration/query-migrate/

	Don't raise error message from cgroups if QEMU fails to start
	The code to remove the cgroup after QEMU failed to startup could
	be obscuring a real error from earlier on. It is not neccessary
	to raise an error in this case, so tell cgroups to keep quiet

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Don't raise cgroups error in QEMU start
	  cleanup code.

	Add missing device type check in QEMU PCI hotunplug
	The QEMU hotunplug code for PCI devices was looking at host
	devices in the guest config without first filtering non
	PCI devices. This means it was reading garbage

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Filter out non-PCI devices

	defined in linux/magic.h.  Unfortunately linux/magic.h
	is not available in RHEL-5, and causes a compile error.
	Just define it locally, since this is something that

	Make domain save work on root-squash NFS
	Move *all* file operations related to creation and writing of libvirt
	header to the domain save file into a hook function that is called by
	virFileOperation. First try to call virFileOperation as root. If that
	fails with EACCESS, and (in the case of Linux) statfs says that we're
	trying to save the file on an NFS share, rerun virFileOperation,
	telling it to fork a child process and setuid to the qemu user. This
	is the only way we can successfully create a file on a root-squashed
	NFS server.

	This patch (along with setting dynamic_ownership=0 in qemu.conf)
	makes qemudDomainSave work on root-squashed NFS.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: provide new qemudDomainSaveFileOpHook()
	  utility, use it in qemudDomainSave() if normal creation of the
	  file as root failed, and after checking the filesystem type for
	  the storage is NFS. In that case we also bypass the security
	  driver, as this would fail on NFS.

2010-03-03  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Fix domain restore for files on root-squash NFS
	If qemudDomainRestore fails to open the domain save file, create a
	pipe, then fork a process that does setuid(qemu_user) and opens the
	file, then reads this file and stuffs it into the pipe. the parent
	libvirtd process will use the other end of the pipe as its fd, then
	reap the child process after it's done reading.

	This makes domain restore work on a root-squash NFS share that is only
	visible to the qemu user.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: add new qemudOpenAsUID() helper function,
	  and use it in qemudDomainRestore() if reading as root directly failed.

2010-03-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix USB/PCI device address aliases in QEMU hotplug driver
	The USB/PCI device hotplug code for the QEMU driver was forgetting
	to allocate a unique device alias.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Fill in device alias for USB/PCI devices

	Fix detection of errors in QEMU device_add command
	The code assumed that 'device_add' returned an empty string upon
	success. This is not true, it sometimes prints random debug info.
	THus we need to check for an explicit fail string

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c: Fix error checking of the device_add
	  monitor command

	There was also a bug in size parameter passed to safewrite() which could
	result in an attempt to write gigabytes out of a megabyte buffer.

	Fix QEMU domain state after a save attempt fails
	When a VM save attempt failed, the VM would be left in a paused
	state. It is neccessary to resume CPU execution upon failure
	if it was running originally

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Resume CPUs upon save failure

	Support job cancellation in QEMU driver
	This supports cancellation of jobs for the QEMU driver against
	the virDomainMigrate, virDomainSave and virDomainCoreDump APIs.
	It is not yet supported for the virDomainRestore API, although
	it is desirable.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Issue 'migrate_cancel' command if
	  virDomainAbortJob is issued during a migration operation
	* tools/virsh.c: Add a domjobabort command

	Remote driver implementation for the virDomainAbortJob APi
	This defines the wire protocol for the new API

	Wire up internal entry points for virDomainAbortJob API
	This provides the internal glue for the driver API

	* src/driver.h: Internal API contract
	* src/libvirt.c, src/libvirt_public.syms: Connect public API
	  to driver API
	* src/esx/esx_driver.c, src/lxc/lxc_driver.c, src/opennebula/one_driver.c,

	  src/test/test_driver.c src/uml/uml_driver.c, src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c,
	  src/xen/xen_driver.c: Stub out entry points

	Introduce public API for cancelling async domain jobs
	The new virDomainAbortJob() method provides a way for a second
	thread to abort an ongoing job run by another thread. This
	extends to any API with  which the virDomainGetJobInfo() API
	is intended to work. Cancellation is not guarenteed, rather best
	effort on part of the hypervisor and not required to be implmented.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in: Define virDomainAbortJob()

	Add QEMU driver support for job info on migration ops
	Introduce support for  virDomainGetJobInfo in the QEMU driver. This
	allows for monitoring of any API that uses the 'info migrate' monitor
	command. ie virDomainMigrate, virDomainSave and virDomainCoreDump

	Unfortunately QEMU does not provide a way to monitor incoming migration
	so we can't wire up virDomainRestore yet.

	The virsh tool gets a new command 'domjobinfo' to query status

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Record virDomainJobInfo and start time
	  in qemuDomainObjPrivatePtr objects. Add generic shared handler
	  for calling 'info migrate' with all migration based APIs.
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c: Fix parsing of 'info migration' reply
	* tools/virsh.c: add new 'domjobinfo' command to query progress

	Remote driver implmentation of job info API
	* src/remote/remote_protocol.x: Define wire protocol format
	  for virDomainGetJobInfo API
	* src/remote/remote_driver.c, daemon/remote.c: Implement client
	  and server marshalling code for virDomainGetJobInfo()
	* daemon/remote_dispatch_args.h, daemon/remote_dispatch_prototypes.h
	  daemon/remote_dispatch_ret.h, daemon/remote_dispatch_table.h,

	  files from src/remote/remote_protocol.x

	Stub out internal driver entry points for job processing
	The internal glue layer for the new pubic API

	* src/driver.h: Define internal driver API contract
	* src/libvirt.c, src/libvirt_public.syms: Wire up public
	  API to internal driver API
	* src/esx/esx_driver.c, src/lxc/lxc_driver.c, src/opennebula/one_driver.c,

	  src/qemu/qemu_driver.c, src/remote/remote_driver.c,
	  src/test/test_driver.c, src/uml/uml_driver.c, src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c,
	  src/xen/xen_driver.c: Stub new entry point

	Introduce public API for domain async job handling
	Introduce a new public API that provides a way to get progress
	info on currently running jobs on a virDomainpPtr. APIs that
	are initially within scope of this idea are

	 virDomainMigrate
	 virDomainMigrateToURI
	 virDomainSave
	 virDomainRestore
	 virDomainCoreDump

	These all take a potentially long time and benefit from monitoring.
	The virDomainJobInfo struct allows for various pieces of information
	to be reported

	 - Percentage completion
	 - Time
	 - Overall data
	 - Guest memory data
	 - Guest disk/file data

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in: Add virDomainGetJobInfo
	* python/generator.py, python/libvirt-override-api.xml,
	  python/libvirt-override.c: Override for virDomainGetJobInfo API
	* python/typewrappers.c, python/typewrappers.h: Introduce wrapper

	Fix PCI address handling when controllers are deleted
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: in qemudDomainDetachPciControllerDevice()

	Expand docs about clock modes
	* formatdomain.html.in: Document new clock options

	Allow configurable timezones with QEMU
	Allow an arbitrary timezone with QEMU by setting the $TZ environment
	variable when launching QEMU

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Set TZ environment variable if a timezone
	  is requested
	* tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c: Add test case for timezones
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-clock-france.xml,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-clock-france.args: Data
	  for timezone tests

	Allow a timezone to be specified instead of sync to host timezone
	This extends the XML to allow for

	  <clock offset='timezone' timezone='Europe/Paris'/>

	This is useful if the admin has not configured any timezone on the
	host OS, but still wants to synchronize a guest to a specific one.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h, src/conf/domain_conf.c: Support extra
	  'timezone' attribute on clock configuration
	* docs/schemas/domain.rng: Add 'timezone' attribute
	* src/xen/xend_internal.c, src/xen/xm_internal.c: Reject configs
	  with a configurable timezone

	Support variable clock offset mode in QEMU
	This allows QEMU guests to be started with an arbitrary clock
	offset

	The test case can't actually be enabled, since QEMU argv expects
	an absolute timestring, and this will obviously change every
	time the test runs :-( Hopefully QEMU will allow a relative
	time offset in the future.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Use the -rtc arg
	  if available to support variable clock offset mode
	* tests/qemuhelptest.c: Add QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_RTC for qemu 0.12.1
	* qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-clock-variable.args,
	  qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-clock-variable.xml,
	  qemuxml2argvtest.c: Test case, except we can't actually enable
	  it yet.

	Add new clock mode allowing variable adjustments
	This introduces a third option for clock offset synchronization,
	that allows an arbitrary / variable adjustment to be set. In
	essence the XML contains the time delta in seconds, relative to
	UTC.

	  <clock offset='variable' adjustment='123465'/>

	The difference from 'utc' mode, is that management apps should
	track adjustments and preserve them at next reboot.

	* docs/schemas/domain.rng: Schema for new clock mode
	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h: Parse
	  new clock time delta
	* src/libvirt_private.syms, src/util/xml.c, src/util/xml.h: Add
	  virXPathLongLong() method

	Change the internal domain conf representation of localtime/utc
	The XML will soon be extended to allow more than just a simple
	localtime/utc boolean flag. This change replaces the plain
	'int localtime' with a separate struct to prepare for future
	extension

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h: Add a new
	  virDomainClockDef structure
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Export virDomainClockOffsetTypeToString

	Use standard spacing for user/pass prompt

	libvirtd: Better initscript error reporting

	qemu: Report binary path if error parsing -help

	remote: Improve daemon startup error reporting
	If I toggle enable_tcp in libvirtd.conf and add --listen in
	/etc/init.d/libvirtd, I get the unhelpful error:

	Starting libvirtd daemon: error: Unable to initialize network sockets.

	Running without --daemon provides much more useful info:

	sudo libvirtd --listen
	11:29:26.117: error : remoteCheckCertFile:270 : Cannot access CA certificate '/etc/pki/CA/cacert.pem': No such file or directory

	The daemon architecture makes it difficult to report this useful
	info if daemonized, so point users to /var/log/messages and
	dropping the --daemon flag if they want more info.

	virsh: Show errors reported by nonAPI functions
	Only API calls trigger the error callback, which is required for
	proper virsh error reporting. Since we use non API functions from
	util/, make sure we properly report these errors.

	Fixes lack of error message from 'virsh create idontexit.xml'

	remote: Improve error message when libvirtd isn't running
	While this could lead people in the wrong direction, people most commonly
	hit this error when libvirtd isn't running, so let's mention a possible
	fix.

	Ignore SIGWINCH in remote client call to poll(2) (RHBZ#567931).
	In bug 567931 we found that virt-top would exit occasionally
	when the terminal window was resized.  Tracking this down it
	turned out that SIGWINCH was being delivered to the process at
	exactly the point where the libvirt remote driver was calling
	poll(2) waiting for a reply from libvirtd.

	This caused the poll(2) call to be interrupted (returning errno
	EINTR).  However handling EINTR the same way as EAGAIN was not
	the solution to this problem since we found previously that this
	would break Ctrl-C handling (commit 47fec8eac2bb3).

	The correct solution is to mask out SIGWINCH for the duration
	of the poll(2) system call.  The per-thread mask is changed and
	restored immediately after the call.  Since we are using
	pthread_sigmask, this should not affect other threads, and
	since we restore the signal mask immediately afterwards it should
	not affect the current thread visibly either.  Other possibly
	problematic signals are SIGCHLD and SIGPIPE and these are
	masked too.

	Note use of ignore_value: It's not fatal if we cannot mask out
	SIGWINCH, and in any case pthread_sigmask never fails on Linux
	as long as you supply the correct arguments.

	I tested this patch and it cures the original problem with
	virt-top.

	Fix daemon-conf invalid failures
	The daemon-conf test would fail on my system if there was a system libvirtd
	running.  In the course of troubleshooting that problem, I discovered that the
	daemon-conf script would always fail if run by itself because it found the line:

	\# that each "PARAMETER = VALUE" line in this file have the parameter

	which it mistook for a line containing a parameter.  I have changed the test to
	avoid mistaking a line containing \"PARAMETER = VALUE\" for a parameter line.

	The corrupted config tests turned out to be failing because the test daemon was
	discovering the pid file from the running daemon and exiting before it processed
	the test config file.  Specifying the pid file for the corrupt config tests in
	the same way as for the valid config test solved that problem.

2010-02-20  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Use virFileOperation hook function in virStorageBackendFileSystemVolBuild
	There were a few operations on the storage volume file that were still
	being done as root, which will fail if the file is on a root-squashed
	NFS share. The result was that attempts to create a storage volume of
	type "raw" on a root-squashed NFS share would fail.

	This patch uses the newly introduced "hook" function in
	virFileOperation to execute all those file operations in the child
	process that's run under the uid that owns the file (and, presumably,
	has permission to write to the NFS share)

	* src/storage/storage_backend.c: use virFileOperation() in
	  virStorageBackendCreateRaw, turning virStorageBackendCreateRaw()
	  into a new createRawFileOpHook() hook

	Rename virFileCreate to virFileOperation, add hook function
	It turns out it is also useful to be able to perform other operations
	on a file created while running as a different uid (eg, write things
	to that file), and possibly to do this to a file that already
	exists. This patch adds an optional hook function to the renamed (for
	more accuracy of purpose) virFileOperation; the hook will be called
	after the file has been opened (possibly created) and gid/mode
	checked/set, before closing it.

	As with the other operations on the file, if the VIR_FILE_OP_AS_UID
	flag is set, this hook function will be called in the context of a
	child process forked from the process that called virFileOperation.
	The implication here is that, while all data in memory is available to
	this hook function, any modification to that data will not be seen by
	the caller - the only indication in memory of what happened in the
	hook will be the return value (which the hook should set to 0 on
	success, or one of the standard errno values on failure).

	Another piece of making the function more flexible was to add an
	"openflags" argument. This arg should contain exactly the flags to be
	passed to open(2), eg O_RDWR | O_EXCL, etc.

	In the process of adding the hook to virFileOperation, I also realized
	that the bits to fix up file owner/group/mode settings after creation
	were being done in the parent process, which could fail, so I moved
	them to the child process where they should be.

	* src/util/util.[ch]: rename and rework virFileCreate-->virFileOperation,
	  and redo flags in virDirCreate
	* storage/storage_backend.c, storage/storage_backend_fs.c: update the
	  calls to virFileOperation/virDirCreate to reflect changes in the API,
	  but don't yet take advantage of the hook.

	macvtap IFF_VNET_HDR configuration
	This patch sets or unsets the IFF_VNET_HDR flag depending on what device
	is used in the VM. The manipulation of the flag is done in the open
	function and is only fatal if the IFF_VNET_HDR flag could not be cleared
	although it has to be (or if an ioctl generally fails). In that case the
	macvtap tap is closed again and the macvtap interface torn.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: pass qemuCmdFlags to
	  qemudPhysIfaceConnect()
	* src/util/macvtap.c src/util/macvtap.h: add vnet_hdr boolean to
	  openMacvtapTap(), and private function configMacvtapTap()

	Use virFork() in __virExec(), virFileCreate() and virDirCreate()
	For __virExec() this is a semantic NOP except for when fork()
	fails. __virExec() would previously forget to restore the signal mask
	in this case; virFork() corrects this behavior.

	virFileCreate() and virDirCreate() gain the code to reset the logging
	and properly deal with the signal handling race condition.

	This also removes a log message that had a typo ("cannot fork o create
	file '%s'") - this error is now logged in a more generic manner in
	virFork() (more generic, but really just as informative, since the
	fact that it's forking to create a file is immaterial to the fact that
	it simply can't fork)

	* src/util/util.c: use the generic virFork() in the 3 functions

	Add virFork() function to utils
	virFork() contains bookkeeping that must be done any time a process
	forks. Currently this includes:

	1) Call virLogLock() prior to fork() and virLogUnlock() just after,
	   to avoid a deadlock if some other thread happens to hold that lock
	   during the fork.

	2) Reset the logging hooks and send all child process log messages to
	   stderr.

	3) Block all signals prior to fork(), then either a) reset the signal
	   mask for the parent process, or b) clear the signal mask for the
	   child process.

	Note that the signal mask handling in __virExec erroneously fails to
	restore the signal mask when fork() fails. virFork() fixes this
	problem.

	Other than this, it attempts to behave as closely to fork() as
	possible (including preserving errno for the caller), with a couple
	exceptions:

	1) The return value is 0 (success) or -1 (failure), while the pid is
	   returned via the pid_t* argument. Like fork(), if pid < 0 there is
	   no child process, otherwise both the child and the parent will
	   return to the caller, and both should look at the return value,
	   which will indicate if some of the extra processing outlined above
	   encountered an error.

	2) If virFork() returns with pid < 0 or with a return value < 0
	   indicating an error condition, the error has already been
	   reported. You can log an additional message if you like, but it
	   isn't necessary, and may be awkwardly extraneous.

	Note that virFork()'s child process will *never* call _exit() - if a
	child process is created, it will return to the caller.

	* util.c util.h: add virFork() function, based on what is currently
	                 done in __virExec().

	qemu: Explicitly error if guest virtual network is inactive

	macvtap teardown rework
	Rework and simplification of teardown of the macvtap device.

	Basically all devices with the same MAC address and link device are kept
	alive and not attempted to be torn down. If a macvtap device linked to a
	physical interface with a certain MAC address 'M' is to be created it
	will automatically fail if the interface is 'up'ed and another macvtap
	with the same properties (MAC addr 'M', link dev) happens to be 'up'.
	This will prevent the VM from starting or the device from being attached
	to a running VM. Stale interfaces are assumed to be there for some
	reason and not stem from libvirt.

	In the VM shutdown path, it's assuming that an interface name is always
	available so that if the device type is DIRECT it can be torn down
	using its name.

	There is no real leak here, but Coverity-Prevent thinks there is.
	It does not see that while there are four ways to return from

	qemu: Make SetVcpu command hotplug only
	Similar to the Set*Mem commands, this implementation was bogus and
	misleading. Make it clear this is a hotplug only operation, and that the
	hotplug piece isn't even implemented.

	Also drop the overkill maxvcpus validation: we don't perform this check
	at XML define time so clearly no one is missing it, and there is
	always the risk that our info will be out of date, possibly preventing
	legitimate CPU values.

	qemu: Make Set*Mem commands hotplug only
	SetMem and SetMaxMem are hotplug only APIs, any persistent config
	changes are supposed to go via XML definition. The original implementation
	of these calls were incorrect and had the nasty side effect of making
	a psuedo persistent change that would be lost after libvirtd restart
	(I didn't know any better).

	Fix these APIs to rightly reject non running domains.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Fix s/video/controller/ typo & slot
	  number typo

	Make error reporting for QEMU JSON mode more friendly
	Current error reporting for JSON mode returns the full JSON
	command string and full JSON error string. This is not very
	user friendly, so this change makes the error report only
	contain the basic command name, and friendly error message
	description string. The full JSON data is logged instead.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c: Always return the 'desc' field from
	  the JSON error message to users.

	Run 'qmp_capabilities' command at QEMU monitor startup
	When in JSON mode, QEMU requires that 'qmp_capabilities' is run as
	the first command in the monitor. This is a no-op when run in the

	Convert virSecurityReportError into a macro
	The virRaiseError macro inside of virSecurityReportError expands to
	virRaiseErrorFull and includes the __FILE__, __FUNCTION__ and __LINE__
	information. But this three values are always the same for every call
	to virSecurityReportError and do not reflect the actual error context.

	Add persistence of PCI addresses to QEMU
	Current PCI addresses are allocated at time of VM startup.

	qemu: Increase guest startup timeout to 30 seconds
	Currently the timeout for reading startup output is 3 seconds. If the

	  Use 'unsigned long long' for QEMU flags

	Remove use of virConnectPtr from security driver APIs
	The virConnectPtr is no longer required for error reporting since

	Fix security driver configuration
	The security driver was mistakenly initialized before the QEMU

	Fix log locking problem when using fork() in the library
	Ad pointed out by Dan Berrange:
	So if some thread in libvirtd is currently executing a logging call,
	while another thread calls virExec(), that other thread no longer
	exists in the child, but its lock is never released. So when the
	child then does virLogReset() it deadlocks.

	The only way I see to address this, is for the parent process to call
	virLogLock(), immediately before fork(), and then virLogUnlock()
	afterwards in both parent & child. This will ensure that no other
	thread
	can be holding the lock across fork().

	* src/util/logging.[ch] src/libvirt_private.syms: export virLogLock() and
	  virLogUnlock()
	* src/util/util.c: lock just before forking and unlock just after - in

	Tweak USB hostdevice XML handling
	When attaching a USB host device based on vendor/product, libvirt
	will resolve the vendor/product into a device/bus pair. This means
	that when printing XML we should allow device/bus info to be printed
	at any time if present

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, docs/schemas/domain.rng: Allow USB device
	  bus info alongside vendor/product

	Fix QEMU hotplug device alias assignment
	To allow devices to be hot(un-)plugged it is neccessary to ensure
	they all have a unique device aliases. This fixes the hotplug
	methods to assign device aliases before invoking the monitor
	commands which need them

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Expose methods
	  for assigning device aliases for disks, host devices and
	  controllers
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Assign device aliases when hotplugging
	  all types of device
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-hostdev-pci-address-device.args,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-hostdev-usb-address-device.args:
	  Update for changed hostdev naming scheme

	Disable QEMU monitor IO debugging by default

	Re-arrange QEMU device alias assignment code
	This patch re-arranges the QEMU device alias assignment code to
	make it easier to call into the same codeblock when performing
	device hotplug. The new code has the ability to skip over already
	assigned names to facilitate hotplug

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Call qemuAssignDeviceNetAlias()
	  instead of qemuAssignNetNames
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Export qemuAssignDeviceNetAlias()
	  instead of qemuAssignNetNames
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Merge the legacy disk/network alias
	  assignment code into the main methods

	Remove direct storage of hostnet_name & vlan
	The current way of assigning names to the host network backend and
	NIC device in QEMU was over complicated, by varying naming scheme
	based on the NIC model and backend type. This simplifies the naming
	to simply be 'net0' and 'hostnet0', allowing code to easily determine
	the host network name and vlan based off the primary device alias
	name 'net0'. This in turn allows removal of alot of QEMU specific
	code from the XML parser, and makes it easier to assign new unique
	names for NICs that are hotplugged

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h: Remove hostnet_name
	  and vlan fields from virNetworkDefPtr
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu/qemu_conf.h, src/qemu/qemu_driver.c:
	  Use a single network alias naming scheme regardless of NIC type
	  or backend type. Determine VLANs from the alias name.
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-net-eth-names.args,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-net-virtio-device.args,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-net-virtio-netdev.args: Update
	  for new simpler naming scheme

	Remove use of -netdev arg with QEMU
	The QEMU 0.12.x tree has the -netdev command line argument, but not
	corresponding monitor command. We can't enable the former, without
	the latter since it will break hotplug/unplug.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Disable -netdev usage
	  until 0.13 at earliest
	* tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c: Add test for -netdev syntax
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-net-virtio-netdev.args,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-net-virtio-netdev.xml: Test
	  data files for -netdev syntax

	Assign PCI addresses before hotplugging devices
	PCI disk, disk controllers, net devices and host devices need to
	have PCI addresses assigned before they are hot-plugged

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Add APIs for ensuring a device has an
	  address and releasing unused addresses
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Ensure all devices have addresses
	  when hotplugging.

	Rewrite way QEMU PCI addresses are allocated
	The current QEMU code allocates PCI addresses incrementally starting
	at 4. This is not satisfactory because the user may have given some
	addresses in their XML config, which need to be skipped over when
	allocating addresses to remaining devices.

	It is thus neccessary to maintain a list of already allocated PCI
	addresses and then only allocate ones that remain unused. This is
	also required for domain device hotplug to work properly later.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Add APIs for creating
	  list of existing PCI addresses, and allocating new addresses.
	  Refactor address assignment to use this code
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Pull PCI address assignment up into the
	  qemuStartVMDaemon() method, as a prelude to moving it into the
	  'define' method. Update list of allocated addresses when connecting
	  to a running VM at daemon startup.
	* tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c, tests/qemuargv2xmltest.c,
	  tests/qemuxml2xmltest.c: Remove USB product test since all
	  passthrough is done based on address
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-hostdev-usb-product.args,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-hostdev-usb-product.xml: Kil
	  unused data files

	Introduce generic virDomainDeviceInfo iterator function
	The virDomainDeviceInfoIterate() function will provide a
	convenient way to iterate over all devices in a domain.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h,
	  src/libvirt_private.syms: Add virDomainDeviceInfoIterate()
	  function.

	Make hotplug use new device_add where possible
	Since QEMU startup uses the new -device argument, the hotplug
	code needs todo the same. This converts disk, network and
	host device hotplug to use the device_add command

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Use new device_add monitor APIs
	  whereever possible

	Introduce internal QEMU monitor APIs for drive + device hotadd
	The way QEMU is started has been changed to use '-device' and
	the new style '-drive' syntax. This needs to be mirrored in
	the hotplug code, requiring addition of two new APIs.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c: Define APIs
	  qemuMonitorAddDevice() and qemuMonitorAddDrive()
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.h:
	  Implement the new monitor APIs

2010-02-02  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Split out QEMU code for building PCI/USB hostdev arg values
	To allow for better code reuse from hotplug methods, the code for

	methods

	* qemu/qemu_conf.h, qemu/qemu_conf.c: Introduce new APis for
	  qemuBuildPCIHostdevPCIDevStr, qemuBuildUSBHostdevUsbDevStr
	  and qemuBuildUSBHostdevDevStr

	Standard internal API syntax for building QEMU command line arguments
	All the helper functions for building command line arguments
	now return a 'char *', instead of acepting a 'char **' or
	virBufferPtr argument

	* qemu/qemu_conf.c: Standardize syntax for building args
	* qemu/qemu_conf.h: Export all functions for building args
	* qemu/qemu_driver.c: Update for changed syntax for building

	udev: Don't let strtoul parse USB busnum and devnum as octal
	udevGetUintProperty was called with base set to 0 for busnum and devnum.
	With base 0 strtoul parses the number as octal if it start with a 0. But
	busnum and devnum are decimal and udev returns them padded with leading
	zeros. So strtoul parses them as octal. This works for certain decimal
	values like 001-007, but fails for values like 008.

	Clarify controllers -device string in QEMU driver
	The QEMU driver contained code to generate a -device string for piix4-ide, but
	wasn't using it. This change removes this string generation. It also adds a
	comment explaining why IDE and FDC controllers don't generate -device strings.

	The change also generates an error if a sata controller is specified for a QEMU
	domain, as this isn't supported.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Remove VIR_DOMAIN_CONTROLLER_TYPE_IDE handler in
	  qemuBuildControllerDevStr(). Ignore IDE and FDC controllers. Error if
	  SATA controller is discovered. Add comments.

2010-02-01  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Fix up a comment in virHashUpdateEntry

	Look in /usr/libexec for the qemu-kvm binary.
	On RHEL-5 the qemu-kvm binary is located in /usr/libexec.
	To reduce confusion for people trying to run upstream libvirt
	on RHEL-5 machines, make the qemu driver look in /usr/libexec
	for the qemu-kvm binary.

	To make this work, I modified virFindFileInPath to handle an
	absolute path correctly.  I also ran into an issue where
	NULL was sometimes being passed for the file parameter
	to virFindFileInPath; it didn't crash prior to this patch
	since it was building paths like /usr/bin/(null).  This
	is non-standard behavior, though, so I added a NULL
	check at the beginning.

	Cleanup of large buffer on stack in virFileMakePath
	virFileMakePath is a recursive function that was creates a buffer
	PATH_MAX bytes long for each recursion (one recursion for each element
	in the path). This changes it to have no buffers on the stack, and to
	allocate just one buffer total, no matter how many elements are in the
	path. Because the modified algorithm requires a char* to be passed in
	rather than const char *, it is now 2 functions - a toplevel API
	function that remains identical in function, and a 2nd helper function
	called for the recursions, which 1) doesn't allocate anything, and 2)
	takes a char* arg, so it can modify the contents.
	* src/util/util.c: rewrite virFileMakePath

	Revert "Fix libvirtd restart for domains with PCI passthrough devices"
	This reverts commit cdc42d0a4865199a941d330dbb6ca1ef426323ae.
	As DanB pointed out, this patch is actually wrong.  The real
	bug that was causing me to see this problem is a bug
	introduced in a RHEL-5 libvirt snapshot, and I'm going to
	fix the real bug there.

	Fix a crash when restarting libvirtd.
	If you shutdown libvirtd while a domain with PCI
	devices is running, then try to restart libvirtd,
	libvirtd will crash.

	This happens because qemuUpdateActivePciHostdevs() is calling
	pciDeviceListSteal() with a dev of 0x0 (NULL), and then trying
	to dereference it.  This patch fixes it up so that
	qemuUpdateActivePciHostdevs() steals the devices after first
	Get()'ting them, avoiding the crash.

	Fix two instances of misspelled 'pseudo'

	thus leak, the "cmd" allocated on the first iteration,
	so be careful to free it in addition to "reply" beforehand.

	Fix libvirtd restart for domains with PCI passthrough devices
	When libvirtd shuts down, it places a <state/> tag in the XML
	state file it writes out for guests with PCI passthrough
	devices.  For devices that are attached at bootup time, the
	state tag is empty.  However, at libvirtd startup time, it
	ignores anything with a <state/> tag in the XML, effectively
	hiding the guest.
	This patch remove the check for VIR_DOMAIN_XML_INTERNAL_STATUS

	qemu: Fix race between device rebind and kvm cleanup
	Certain hypervisors (like qemu/kvm) map the PCI bar(s) on
	the host when doing device passthrough.  This can lead to a race
	condition where the hypervisor is still cleaning up the device while
	libvirt is trying to re-attach it to the host device driver.  To avoid
	this situation, we look through /proc/iomem, and if the hypervisor is
	still holding onto the bar (denoted by the string in the matcher variable),
	then we can wait around a bit for that to clear up.

	Fix device assignment with root devices
	The patches to add ACS checking to PCI device passthrough
	introduced a bug.  With the current code, if you try to
	passthrough a device on the root bus (i.e. bus 0), then
	it denies the passthrough.  This is because the code in
	pciDeviceIsBehindSwitchLackingACS() to check for a parent
	device doesn't take into account the possibility of the
	root bus.  If we are on the root bus, it means we
	legitimately can't find a parent, and it also means that
	we don't have to worry about whether ACS is enabled.
	Therefore return 0 (indicating we don't lack ACS) from
	pciDeviceIsBehindSwitchLackingACS().

	not restored to original permissions. Finally there was a bogus
	call to set hostdev permissions in the hostdev unplug code

	* qemu/qemu_driver.c: Fix security driver usage in hotplug/unplug

	Add missing call to re-attach host devices if VM startup fails
	If there is a problem with VM startup, PCI devices may be left

	Pull initial disk labelling out into libvirtd instead of exec hook
	Pulling the disk labelling code out of the exec hook, and into
	libvirtd will allow it to access shared state in the daemon. It
	will also make debugging & error reporting easier / more reliable.

	* qemu/qemu_driver.c: Move initial disk labelling calls up into
	  libvirtd. Add cleanup of disk labels upon failure

	Fix leak of allocated security label
	If a VM fails to start, we can't simply free the security label
	strings, we must call the domainReleaseSecurityLabel() method
	otherwise the reserved 'mcs' level will be leaked in SElinux

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Invoke domainReleaseSecurityLabel()
	  when domain fails to start

	Refactor setup & cleanup of security labels in security driver
	The current security driver architecture has the following
	split of logic

	 * domainGenSecurityLabel

	    Allocate the unique label for the domain about to be started

	 * domainGetSecurityLabel

	    Retrieve the current live security label for a process

	 * domainSetSecurityLabel

	    Apply the previously allocated label to the current process
	    Setup all disk image / device labelling

	 * domainRestoreSecurityLabel

	    Restore the original disk image / device labelling.
	    Release the unique label for the domain

	The 'domainSetSecurityLabel' method is special because it runs
	in the context of the child process between the fork + exec.

	This is require in order to set the process label. It is not
	required in order to label disks/devices though. Having the
	disk labelling code run in the child process limits what it
	can do.

	In particularly libvirtd would like to remember the current
	disk image label, and only change shared image labels for the
	first VM to start. This requires use & update of global state
	in the libvirtd daemon, and thus cannot run in the child
	process context.

	The solution is to split domainSetSecurityLabel into two parts,
	one applies process label, and the other handles disk image
	labelling. At the same time domainRestoreSecurityLabel is
	similarly split, just so that it matches the style. Thus the
	previous 4 methods are replaced by the following 6 new methods

	 * domainGenSecurityLabel

	    Allocate the unique label for the domain about to be started
	    No actual change here.

	 * domainReleaseSecurityLabel

	   Release the unique label for the domain

	 * domainGetSecurityProcessLabel

	   Retrieve the current live security label for a process
	   Merely renamed for clarity.

	 * domainSetSecurityProcessLabel

	   Apply the previously allocated label to the current process

	 * domainRestoreSecurityAllLabel

	    Restore the original disk image / device labelling.

	 * domainSetSecurityAllLabel

	    Setup all disk image / device labelling

	The SELinux and AppArmour drivers are then updated to comply with
	this new spec. Notice that the AppArmour driver was actually a
	little different. It was creating its profile for the disk image
	and device labels in the 'domainGenSecurityLabel' method, where as
	the SELinux driver did it in 'domainSetSecurityLabel'. With the
	new method split, we can have consistency, with both drivers doing
	that in the domainSetSecurityAllLabel method.

	NB, the AppArmour changes here haven't been compiled so may not
	build.

	Make security drivers responsible for checking dynamic vs static labelling
	The QEMU driver is doing 90% of the calls to check for static vs
	dynamic labelling. Except it is forgetting todo so in many places,
	in particular hotplug is mistakenly assigning disk labels. Move
	all this logic into the security drivers themselves, so the HV
	drivers don't have to think about it.

	* src/security/security_driver.h: Add virDomainObjPtr parameter
	  to virSecurityDomainRestoreHostdevLabel and to
	  virSecurityDomainRestoreSavedStateLabel
	* src/security/security_selinux.c, src/security/security_apparmor.c:
	  Add explicit checks for VIR_DOMAIN_SECLABEL_STATIC and skip all
	  chcon() code in those cases
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Remove all checks for VIR_DOMAIN_SECLABEL_STATIC
	  or VIR_DOMAIN_SECLABEL_DYNAMIC. Add missing checks for possibly NULL
	  driver entry points.

	Create storage pool directories with proper uid/gid/mode
	Previously the uid/gid/mode in the xml was ignored when creating new
	storage pool directories. This commit attempts to honor the requested
	permissions, and spits out an error if it can't.

	Note that when creating the directory, the rest of the path leading up
	to the final element is created using current uid/gid/mode, and the
	final element gets the settings from xml. It is NOT an error for the
	directory to already exist; in this case, the perms for the existing
	directory are just set (if necessary).

	* src/storage/storage_backend_fs.c: update the virStorageBackendFileSystemBuild
	  function to check the directory hierarchy separately then create the
	  leaf directory with the right attributes

	Create storage volumes directly with desired uid/gid
	In order to avoid problems trying to chown files that were created by
	root on a root-squashing nfs server, fork a new process that setuid's
	to the desired uid before creating the file. (It's only done this way
	if the pool containing the new volume is of type 'netfs', otherwise
	the old method of creating the file followed by chown() is used.)

	This changes the semantics of the "create_func" slightly - previously
	it was assumed that this function just created the file, then the
	caller would chown it to the desired uid. Now, create_func does both
	operations.

	There are multiple functions that can take on the role of create_func:

	createFileDir - previously called mkdir(), now calls virDirCreate().
	virStorageBackendCreateRaw - previously called open(),
	                             now calls virFileCreate().
	virStorageBackendCreateQemuImg - use virRunWithHook() to setuid/gid.
	virStorageBackendCreateQcowCreate - same.
	virStorageBackendCreateBlockFrom - preserve old behavior (but attempt
	                                   chown when necessary even if not root)

	* src/storage/storage_backend.[ch] src/storage/storage_backend_disk.c
	  src/storage/storage_backend_fs.c src/storage/storage_backend_logical.c
	  src/storage/storage_driver.c: change the create_func implementations,
	  also propagate the pool information to be able to detect NETFS ones.

	New utility functions virFileCreate and virDirCreate
	These functions create a new file or directory with the given
	uid/gid. If the flag VIR_FILE_CREATE_AS_UID is given, they do this by
	forking a new process, calling setuid/setgid in the new process, and
	then creating the file. This is better than simply calling open then
	fchown, because in the latter case, a root-squashing nfs server would
	create the new file as user nobody, then refuse to allow fchown.

	If VIR_FILE_CREATE_AS_UID is not specified, the simpler tactic of
	creating the file/dir, then chowning is is used. This gives better
	results in cases where the parent directory isn't on a root-squashing
	NFS server, but doesn't give permission for the specified uid/gid to
	create files. (Note that if the fork/setuid method fails to create the
	file due to access privileges, the parent process will make a second
	attempt using this simpler method.)

	If the bit VIR_FILE_CREATE_ALLOW_EXIST is set in the flags, an
	existing file/directory will not cause an error; in this case, the
	function will simply set the permissions of the file/directory to
	those requested. If VIR_FILE_CREATE_ALLOW_EXIST is not specified, an
	existing file/directory is considered (and reported as) an error.

	Return from both of these functions is 0 on success, or the value of
	errno if there was a failure.

	* src/util/util.[ch]: add the 2 new util functions

	Add virRunWithHook util function
	* src/util/util.[ch]: similar to virExecWithHook, but waits for child to
	  exit. Useful for doing things like setuid after the fork but before the
	  exec.

	Make all bitfields unsigned ints to avoid unexpected values in casts
	The 'int virInterfaceIsActive()' method was directly returning the
	value of the 'int active:1' bitfield in virIntefaceDefPtr. A bitfield
	with a signed integer, will hold the values 0 and -1, not 0 and +1
	as might be expected. This meant that virInterfaceIsActive() was
	always returning -1 when the interface was active, not +1 & thus all
	callers thought an error had occurred. To protect against this kind
	of mistake again, change all bitfields to be unsigned ints

	Update interface.rng and xml test files to match netcf 0.1.5
	The RNG now supports IPv6 and bonds attached to bridges, along with
	some other minor tweaks. All test files from netcf have been copied to
	the test directory and added to the xml2xml and schema tests (and they
	all pass, of course ;-)

	Support bond interfaces attached to bridges in interface xml.
	This was accomplished in xml parsing by doing away with the
	stripped-down virInterfaceBareDef object, and just always using
	virInterfaceDef, but with restrictions in certain places (eg, the type
	of subordinate interface allowed in parsing depends on the parent
	interface).

	xml formatting was similarly adjusted. In addition, the formatting
	functions keep track of the level of interface nesting, and insert
	extra leading spaces on each line accordingly (using %*s).

	The only change in formatted xml from previous (aside frmo supporting
	new combinations of interface types) is that the subordinate ethernet
	interfaces take up 2 lines rather than one, eg:

	   <interface type='ethernet' name='eth0'>
	   </interface>

	instead of:

	   <interface type='ethernet' name='eth0'/>

	Allow empty bridges in interface xml.

	Support delay property in interface bridge xml.

	Remove superfluous new lines from messages
	I noticed some debug messages are printed with an empty lines after
	them. This patch removes these empty lines from all invocations of the
	following macros:
	    VIR_DEBUG
	    VIR_DEBUG0
	    VIR_ERROR
	    VIR_ERROR0
	    VIR_INFO
	    VIR_WARN
	    VIR_WARN0

	Use pciDeviceIsAssignable in qemu driver

	Tests for ACS in PCIe switches
	New pciDeviceIsAssignable() function for checking whether a given PCI
	device can be assigned to a guest was added. Currently it only checks
	for ACS being enabled on all PCIe switches between root and the PCI
	device. In the future, it could be the right place to check whether a
	device is unbound or bound to a stub driver.

	Add Jiri Denemark <jdenemar@redhat.com> to commiters

2010-01-19  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Allow for CPU topology specification without model
	Currently CPU topology may only be specified together with CPU model:
	    <cpu match='exact'>
	        <model>name</model>
	        <topology sockets='1' cores='2' threads='3'/>
	    </cpu>

	This patch allows for CPU topology specification without the need for
	also specifying CPU model:
	    <cpu>
	        <topology sockets='1' cores='2' threads='3'/>
	    </cpu>

	'match' attribute and 'model' element are made optional with the
	restriction that 'match' attribute has to be set when 'model' is
	present.

	Add debug messages for CPU incompatibility
	When comparing incompatible CPUs, the reason for this incompatibility is
	logged as a debug message.

	Take disabled/forced CPU features into account
	When comparing x86 CPUs, features with 'disabled' policy were mistakenly
	required to be supported by the host CPU.

	Likewise, features with 'force' policy which were supported by host CPU
	would make CPUs incompatible if 'strict' match was used by guest CPU.

	This patch fixes both issues.

	Implement CPU topology support for QEMU driver
	QEMU's command line equivalent for the following domain XML fragment
	    <vcpus>2</vcpus>
	    <cpu ...>
	        ...
	        <topology sockets='1' cores='2', threads='1'/>
	    </cpu>

	is

	    -smp 2,sockets=1,cores=2,threads=1

	This syntax was introduced in QEMU-0.12.

	Version 2 changes:
	- -smp argument build split into a separate function
	- always add ",sockets=S,cores=C,threads=T" to -smp if qemu supports it
	- use qemuParseCommandLineKeywords for command line parsing

	Version 3 changes:
	- ADD_ARG_LIT => ADD_ARG and line reordering in qemudBuildCommandLine
	- rebased

	Enhance qemuParseCommandLineKeywords
	Current version expects name=value,... list and when an incorrect string
	such as "a,b,c=d" would be parsed as "a,b,c" keyword with "d" value
	without reporting any error, which is probably not the expected
	behavior.

	This patch adds an extra argument called allowEmptyValue, which if
	non-zero will permit keywords with no value; "a,b=c,,d=" will be parsed
	as follows:
	    keyword value
	    "a"     NULL
	    "b"     "c"
	    ""      NULL
	    "d"     ""

	In case allowEmptyValue is zero, the string is required to contain
	name=value pairs only; retvalues is guaranteed to contain non-NULL
	pointers. Now, "a,b,c=d" will result in an error.

	Convert VirtIO balloon over to -device syntax
	Replace

	   -balloon virtio

	With

	   -device virtio-balloon-pci,id=balloon0,bus=pci.0,addr=0x3

	This allows it to get correct assigned PCI address as declared in
	previous patch

	 * src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Convert Virtio ballon to -device and
	   give it an explicit PCI address
	 * tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-*args: Add in virtio balloon
	   where appropriate

	Auto-assign PCI addresses
	Instead of relying on QEMU to assign PCI addresses and then querying
	them with 'info pci', manually assign all PCI addresses before starting
	the guest.  These addresses are not stable across reboots. That will
	come in a later patch

	NB, the PIIX3 (IDE, FDC, ISA-Bridge) will always have slot 1 and
	VGA will always have slot 2. We declare the Virtio Balloon gets
	slot 3, and then all remaining slots are for configured devices.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: If -device is supported, then assign all PCI
	  addresses when building the command line
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Don't query monitor for PCI addresses if
	  they have already been assigned
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-hostdev-pci-address-device.args,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-net-virtio-device.args,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-sound-device.args,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-watchdog-device.args: Update
	  to include PCI slot/bus information

	Pass -vga none if no video card specified
	QEMU always configures a VGA card. If no video card is included in
	the libvirt XML, it is neccessary to explicitly turn off the default
	using -vga none

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Pass -vga none if no video card is configured
	* tests/qemuargv2xmltest.c, tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c: Test for
	  handling -vga none.
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-nographics-vga.args,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-nographics-vga.xml: Test
	  data files

	Add support for explicit -sdl flag to QEMU
	Not all QEMU builds default to SDL graphics for their display.
	Newer QEMU now has an explicit -sdl flag, which we can use to
	explicitly request SDL intead of relying on the default. This
	protects libvirt against unexpected changes in graphics default

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Probe for -sdl
	  flag and use it if it is found
	* tests/qemuhelptest.c: Add SDL flag to tests

	Convert guestfwd to -device, and add -sdl explicit args
	The old syntax was

	   -chardev SOMECONFIG
	   -nic user,guestfwd=tcp:IP:PORT-chardev:CHARDEV

	The new syntax is

	   -chardev SOMECONFIG
	   -netdev user,guestfwd=tcp:IP:PORT,chardev=ID,id=user-ID

	Convert PCI device assignment over to -device
	The old syntax is

	  -pcidevice host=BUS:SLOT:FUNCTION

	The new syntax is

	  -device pci-assign,host=BUS:SLOT:FUNCTION,addr=<PCI SLOT>,id=host0

	Convert USB input devices to -device

	Convert USB hostdevices over to -device
	The old syntax was

	   -usbdevice host:PRODUCT:VENDOR

	Or

	   -usbdevice host:BUS.DEV

	The new syntax is

	   -device usb-host,product=PRODUCT,vendor=VENDOR

	Or

	   -device usb-host,hostbus=BUS,hostaddr=DEV

	Convert USB disks over to -device
	The previous syntax was severely limited in its options

	  -usbdevice disk:/home/berrange/output.img

	The new syntax is the same as for other disk types

	  -drive file=/home/berrange/output.img,if=none,id=usb-1,index=1
	  -device usb-storage,drive=usb-1

	Again, the index= arg is wrong here, and will be removed in a
	later merge

	Convert NICs over to use -device & -netdev where possible
	The current syntax uses a pair of args

	   -net nic,macaddr=52:54:00:56:6c:55,vlan=3,model=pcnet,name=pcnet.0
	   -net user,vlan=3,name=user.0

	The new syntax does not  need the vlan craziness anymore, and
	so has a simplified pair of args

	   -netdev user,id=user.0
	   -device pcnet,netdev=user.0,id=pcnet.0,mac=52:54:00:56:6c:55,addr=<PCI SLOT>

	Convert disk drive over to use -device where available
	The current preferred syntax for disk drives uses

	  -drive file=/vms/plain.qcow,if=virtio,index=0,boot=on,format=qcow

	The new syntax splits this up into a pair of linked args

	  -drive file=/vms/plain.qcow,if=none,id=drive-virtio-0,format=qcow2
	  -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=drive-virtio-0,id=virtio-0,addr=<PCI SLOT>

	SCSI/IDE devices also get a bus property linking them to the
	controller

	  -device scsi-disk,drive=drive-scsi0-0-0,id=scsi0-0-0,bus=scsi0.0,scsi-id=0
	  -device ide-drive,drive=drive-ide0-0-0,id=ide0-0-0,bus=ide0,unit=0

	Convert audio devices over to -device syntax
	The current syntax for audio devices is a horrible multiplexed
	arg

	    -soundhw sb16,pcspk,ac97

	The new syntax is

	    -device sb16,id=sound0

	or

	    -device AC97,id=sound1,addr=<PCI SLOT>

	NB, pcspk still uses the old -soundhw syntax

	Convert watchdog to -device
	The current syntax for watchdogs is

	    -watchdog i6300esb

	The new syntax will now be

	    -device i6300esb,id=watchdogNN,addr=<PCI-SLOT>

	Convert character devices over to use -device
	The current character device syntax uses either

	  -serial tty,path=/dev/ttyS2

	Or

	  -chardev tty,id=serial0,path=/dev/ttyS2 -serial chardev:serial0

	With the new -device support, we now prefer

	  -chardev file,id=serial0,path=/tmp/serial.log -device isa-serial,chardev=serial0

	This patch changes the existing -chardev syntax to use this new
	scheme, and fallbacks to the old plain -serial syntax for old
	QEMU.

	The monitor device changes to

	  -chardev socket,id=monitor,path=/tmp/test-monitor,server,nowait -mon chardev=monitor

	In addition, this patch adds --nodefaults, which kills off the
	default serial, parallel, vga and nic devices. THis avoids the
	need for us to explicitly turn each off

	Assign device aliases for all devices at startup
	When starting a guest, give every device a unique alias. This will
	be used for the 'id' parameter in -device args in later patches.
	It can also be used to uniquely identify devices in the monitor

	For old QEMU without -device, assign disk names based on QEMU's
	historical naming scheme.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Assign unique device aliases
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Remove obsolete qemudDiskDeviceName
	  and use the device alias in eject & blockstats commands

2010-01-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	storage_backend_fs.c: do not ignore probe failure
	* src/storage/storage_backend_fs.c (virStorageBackendFileSystemRefresh):
	Correct parentheses.  The documented intent is to ignore non-regular
	files, yet due to a parenthesization error all errors were handled
	that way.

2010-01-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Probe for -device and use -nodefaults
	Probe for the new -device flag and if available set the -nodefaults
	flag, instead of using -net none, -serial none or -parallel none.
	Other device types will be converted to use -device in later patches.
	The -nodefaults flag will help avoid unwelcome surprises from future
	QEMU releases

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Probe for -device. Add -nodefaults flag.
	  Remove -net none, -serial none or -parallel none
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Define QEMU_CMD_FLAG_DEVICE
	* tests/qemuhelpdata/qemu-0.12.1: New data file for 0.12.1 QEMU
	* tests/qemuhelptest.c: Test feature extraction from 0.12.1 QEMU

	Add device info to serial, parallel, channel, input & fs devices
	Although the serial, parallel, chanel, input & fs devices do
	not have PCI address info, they can all have device aliases.
	Thus it neccessary to associate the virDomainDeviceInfo data
	with them all.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h: Add hooks for
	  parsing / formatting device info for serial, parallel, channel
	  input and fs devices.
	* docs/schemas/domain.rng: Associate device info with character
	  devices, input & fs device

	Introduce device aliases
	This patch introduces the support for giving all devices a short,
	unique name, henceforth known as a 'device alias'.  These aliases
	are not set by the end user, instead being assigned by the hypervisor
	if it decides it want to support this concept.

	The QEMU driver sets them whenever using the -device arg syntax
	and uses them for improved hotplug/hotunplug. it is the intent
	that other APIs (block / interface stats & device hotplug) be
	able to accept device alias names in the future.

	The XML syntax is

	   <alias name="video0"/>

	This may appear in any type of device that supports device info.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h: Add a 'alias'
	  field to virDomainDeviceInfo struct & parse/format it in XML
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Export virDomainDefClearDeviceAliases
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Replace use of "nic_name" field with the
	  standard device alias
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Clear device aliases at shutdown

	Clear assigned PCI devices at shutdown
	The PCI device addresses are only valid while the VM is running,
	since they are auto-assigned by QEMU. After shutdown they must
	all be cleared. Future QEMU driver enhancement will allow for
	persistent PCI address assignment

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h, src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/libvirt_private.syms
	  Add virDomainDefClearPCIAddresses() method for wiping out auto assigned
	  PCI addresses
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Clear PCI addresses at VM shutdown

	Auto-add disk controllers based on defined disks
	Existing applications using libvirt are not aware of the disk
	controller concept. Thus, after parsing the <disk> definitions
	in the XML, it is neccessary to create <controller> elements
	to satisfy all requested disks, as per their defined drive
	addresses

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h,
	  src/libvirt_private.syms: Add virDomainDefAddDiskControllers()
	  method for populating disk controllers, and call it after
	  parsing disk definitions.
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Call virDomainDefAddDiskControllers()
	  when doing ARGV -> XML conversion
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv*.xml: Add disk controller
	  data to all data files which don't have it already

	Avoid free'ing a constant string in chardev lookup code
	 * src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c: Don't free const string in
	   qemuMonitorTextGetPtyPaths()

	Remove restriction on duplicated sound devices in parser
	It is perfectly acceptable to have multiple sound devices of
	same type in guest configuration. If the underlying hypervisor
	does not like this, it is its job to complain, not the XML
	parser's

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c: Remove hack which deleted duplicated
	  sound device models.
	* tests/xml2sexprdata/xml2sexpr-fv-sound.xml: Remove duplicate
	  models

	Detect PCI addresses at QEMU startup
	Hotunplug of devices requires that we know their PCI address. Even
	hotplug of SCSI drives, required that we know the PCI address of
	the SCSI controller to attach the drive to. We can find this out
	by running 'info pci' and then correlating the vendor/product IDs
	with the devices we booted with.

	Although this approach is somewhat fragile, it is the only viable
	option with QEMU < 0.12, since there is no way for libvirto set
	explicit PCI addresses when creating devices in the first place.
	For QEMU > 0.12, this code will not be used.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Assign all dynamic PCI addresses on
	  startup of QEMU VM, matching vendor/product IDs
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.h: Add
	  API for fetching PCI device address mapping

	Properly support SCSI drive hotplug
	The current SCSI hotplug support attaches a brand new SCSI controller
	for every disk. This is broken because the semantics differ from those
	used when starting the VM initially. In the latter case, each SCSI
	controller is filled before a new one is added.

	If the user specifies an high drive index (sdazz) then at initial
	startup, many intermediate SCSI controllers may be added with no
	drives.

	This patch changes SCSI hotplug so that it exactly matches the
	behaviour of initial startup. First the SCSI controller number is
	determined for the drive to be hotplugged. If any controller upto
	and including that controller number is not yet present, it is
	attached. Then finally the drive is attached to the last controller.

	NB, this breaks SCSI hotunplug, because there is no 'drive_del'
	command in current QEMU. Previous SCSI hotunplug was broken in
	any case because it was unplugging the entire controller, not
	just the drive in question.

	A future QEMU will allow proper SCSI hotunplug of a drive.

	This patch is derived from work done by Wolfgang Mauerer on disk
	controllers.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Fix SCSI hotplug to add a drive to
	 the correct controller, instead of just attaching a new
	  controller.
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.h: Add
	  support for 'drive_add' command

2010-01-18  Wolfgang Mauerer  <wolfgang.mauerer@siemens.com>

	Implement SCSI controller hotplug/unplug for QEMU
	This patch allows for explicit hotplug/unplug of SCSI controllers.
	Ordinarily this is not required, since QEMU/libvirt will attach
	a new SCSI controller whenever one is required. Allowing explicit
	hotplug of controllers though, enables the caller to specify a
	static PCI address, instead of auto-assigning the next available
	PCI slot. Or it will when we have static PCI addressing.

	This patch is derived from Wolfgang Mauerer's disk controller
	patch series.

	Use closest CPU model when decoding from CPUID
	Current implementation of x86Decode() used for CPUID -> model+features
	translation does not always select the closest CPU model. When walking
	through all models from cpu_map.xml the function considers a new
	candidate as a better choice than a previously selected candidate only
	if the new one is a superset of the old one. In case the new candidate
	is closer to host CPU but lacks some feature comparing to the old
	candidate, the function does not choose well.

	This patch changes the algorithm so that the closest model is always
	selected. That is, the model which requires the lowest number of
	additional features to describe host CPU.

2010-01-18  Diego Elio Pettenò  <flameeyes@gmail.com>

	Change detection of xen so that it's actually automatic rather than forced.
	This ensures that ./configure will work fine if xen development packages
	are not around, rather than fail. When passing ./configure --with-xen, the
	lack of xen development packages become fatal.

	Standardise ./configure --help options reporting.
	Always use AC_HELP_STRING for the help text for options at ./configure,
	so that the output is properly aligned.

	Use proper quadrigraphs for outputting the brackets.

	Always use autoconf-style [default=$foo] output to state the default, both
	where it was stated before and where it wasn't.

	This time, include Matthias Bolte notes regarding defaults, and removing
	PFX specification from phyp.

	qemu: Use log output for pty assignment if 'info chardev' is unavailable
	qemudFindCharDevicePTYsMonitor reports an error if 'info chardev' didn't
	provide information for a requested device, even if the log output parsing
	had found the pty path for that device. This makes pty assignment fail for
	older QEMU/KVM versions. For example KVM 72 on Debian doesn't support
	'info chardev', so qemuMonitorTextGetPtyPaths cannot parse any useful
	information and the hash for device-id-to-pty-path mapping stays empty.

	Make qemudFindCharDevicePTYsMonitor report an error only if the log output
	parsing and the 'info chardev' parsing failed to provide the pty path.

	Fix build of Xen proxy daemon
	* src/conf/domain_conf.c: Allow virDomainDeviceInfoIsSet,
	  virDomainDeviceInfoClear & virDomainDeviceInfoFormat when
	  building Xen proxy

	Remove obsolete comment in QEMU JSON code
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c: We fill in the PCI function number
	   now, so remove obsolete XXX comment

	Specify bus/unit instead of index for disks with QEMU
	The current code for using -drive simply sets the -drive 'index'
	parameter. QEMU internally converts this to bus/unit depending
	on the type of drive. This does not give us precise control over
	the bus/unit assignment though. This change switches over to make
	libvirt explicitly calculate the bus/unit number.

	In addition bus/unit/index are actually irrelevant for VirtIO
	disks, since each virtio disk is a separate PCI device. No disk
	controller is involved.

	Doing the conversion to bus/unit in libvirt allows us to correctly
	attach SCSI controllers when required.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Specify bus/unit instead of index for
	  disks
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-disk*.args: Switch over from
	  using index=NNNN, to bus=NN, unit=NN for SCSI/IDE/Floppy disks

	Split code for building QEMU -drive arg in separate method
	To enable it to be called from multiple locations, split out
	the code for building the -drive arg string. This will be needed
	by later patches which do drive hotplug, the conversion to use
	-device, and the conversion to controller/bus/unit addressing

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Add qemuBuildDriveStr
	  for building -drive arg string

	Convert monitor over to use virDomainDeviceAddress
	Convert the QEMU monitor APIs over to use virDomainDeviceAddress

	Minor fixes for API extension doc
	Update the API Extensions doc to reflect new source directory layout.

2010-01-16  Wolfgang Mauerer  <wolfgang.mauerer@siemens.com>

	Add new domain device: "controller"
	This augments virDomainDevice with a <controller> element
	that is used to represent disk controllers (e.g., scsi
	controllers). The XML format is given by

	  <controller type="scsi" index="<num>">
	     <address type="pci" domain="0xNUM" bus="0xNUM" slot="0xNUM"/>
	  </controller>

	where type denotes the disk interface (scsi, ide,...), index
	is an integer that identifies the controller for association
	with disks, and the <address> element specifies the controller
	address on the PCI bus as described in previous commits
	The address element can be omitted; in this case, an address
	will be assigned automatically.

	Most of the code in this patch is from Wolfgang Mauerer's
	previous disk controller series

	 * docs/schemas/domain.rng: Define syntax for <controller>
	   XML element
	 * src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h: Define
	   virDomainControllerDef struct, and routines for parsing
	   and formatting XML
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Add virDomainControllerInsert
	   and virDomainControllerDefFree

2010-01-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Set default disk controller/bus/unit props
	When parsing the <disk> element specification, if no <address>
	is provided for the disk, then automatically assign one based on
	the <target dev='sdXX'/> device name. This provides for backwards
	compatability with existing applications using libvirt, while also
	allowing new apps to have complete fine grained control.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h, src/conf/domain_conf.c,
	  src/libvirt_private.syms: Add virDomainDiskDefAssignAddress()
	  for assigning a controller/bus/unit address based on disk target
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Call virDomainDiskDefAssignAddress() after
	  generating XML from ARGV
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/*.xml: Add in drive address information
	  to all XML files

	Add address info to sound, video and watchdog devices
	Add the virDomainDeviceAddress information to the sound, video
	and watchdog devices. This means all of them gain the new XML
	element

	  <address .... />

	This brings them upto par with disk/net/hostdev devices which
	already have address info

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h: Add virDomainDeviceAddress to sound,
	  video & watchdog device struts.
	* src/conf/domain_conf.c: Hook up parsing/formatting for
	  virDomainDeviceAddress in sound, video & watchdog devices
	* docs/schemas/domain.rng: Associate device address info
	  with sound, video & watchdog

	Extend the virDomainDeviceAddress struture to allow disk controller addresses
	Introduce a new structure

	      struct _virDomainDeviceDriveAddress {
	        unsigned int controller;
	        unsigned int bus;
	        unsigned int unit;
	      };

	and plug that into virDomainDeviceAddress and generates XML that
	looks like

	  <address type='drive' controller='1' bus='0' unit='5'/>

	This syntax will be used by the QEMU driver to explicitly control
	how drives are attached to the bus

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h, src/conf/domain_conf.c: Parsing and
	  formatting of drive addresses
	* docs/schemas/domain.rng: Define new address format for drives

	Introduce a standardized data structure for device addresses
	All guest devices now use a common device address structure
	summarized by:

	  enum virDomainDeviceAddressType {
	    VIR_DOMAIN_DEVICE_ADDRESS_TYPE_NONE,
	    VIR_DOMAIN_DEVICE_ADDRESS_TYPE_PCI,
	  };

	  struct _virDomainDevicePCIAddress {
	    unsigned int domain;
	    unsigned int bus;
	    unsigned int slot;
	    unsigned int function;
	  };

	  struct _virDomainDeviceInfo {
	    int type;
	    union {
	        virDomainDevicePCIAddress pci;
	    } addr;
	  };

	This replaces the anonymous structs in Disk/Net/Hostdev data
	structures. Where available, the address is *always* printed
	in the XML file, instead of being hidden in the internal state
	file.

	  <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x1e' slot='0x07' function='0x0'/>

	The structure definition is based on Wolfgang Mauerer's disk
	controller patch series.

	* docs/schemas/domain.rng: Define the <address> syntax and
	  associate it with disk/net/hostdev devices
	* src/conf/domain_conf.h, src/conf/domain_conf.c,
	  src/libvirt_private.syms: APIs for parsing/formatting address
	  information. Also remove the QEMU specific 'pci_addr' attributes
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Replace use of 'pci_addr' attrs with
	  new standardized format.

	Make test suite output less verbose
	Only print out '.' for each test case, full test output can be
	re-enabled with VIR_TEST_VERBOSE=1, or VIR_TEST_DEBUG=XXXX

	Sample output now looks like

	  TEST: statstest
	        ........................................ 40
	        ...................................      75  OK
	  PASS: statstest
	  TEST: qparamtest

	util: Make sure virExec hook failures are raised
	With the introduction virDispatchError, hook function errors are

	these messages.

	Fix this by calling virDispatchError after hook failure.

	Implement path lookup for USB by vendor:product
	Based off how QEMU does it, look through /sys/bus/usb/devices/* for
	matching vendor:product info, and if found, use info from the surrounding
	files to build the device's /dev/bus/usb path.

	This fixes USB device assignment by vendor:product when running qemu
	as non-root (well, it should, but for some reason I couldn't reproduce
	the failure people are seeing in [1], but it appears to work properly)

	node_device: udev: Fix memory leak
	We are setting the same property two different ways without
	free'ing in between. Just drop the second assignment.

	node_device: udev: Enumerate floppy devices
	There are quite a few differences between how udev exposes legacy
	and USB floppy devs, but this patch takes care of both variants.

	node_device: udev: Use base 16 for product/vendor
	udev doesn't prefix USB product/vendor info with '0x', so the
	strtol conversions were wrong for the product field (vendor already
	set the correct base). Make the change for PCI product/vendor as
	well to be safe.

	This fixes USB device assignment via virt-manager.

	Ensure error handling callback functions are called from safe context
	The virRaiseErrorFull() may invoke the error handler callback
	functions an application has registered. This is not good
	because the connection object may not be available at this
	point, and the caller may be holding locks. This creates a
	problem if the error handler calls back into libvirt.

	The solutuon is to move invocation of the handler into the
	final cleanup code in the public API entry points, where it
	is guarenteed to have safe state.

	* src/libvirt.c: Invoke virDispatchError() in all error paths
	* src/util/virterror.c: Remove virSetConnError/virSetGlobalError,
	  replacing with virDispatchError(). Move invocation of the

	virsh: Add persistent history using libreadline

	esx: Fix 'vpx' MAC address range and allow arbitrary MAC addresses
	The MAC addresses with 00:50:56 prefix are split into several ranges:

	  00:50:56:00:00:00 - 00:50:56:3f:ff:ff  'static' range (manually assigned)
	  00:50:56:80:00:00 - 00:50:56:bf:ff:ff  'vpx' range (assigned by a VI Client)

	Erroneously the 'vpx' range was assumed to be larger and to occupy the
	remaining addresses of the 00:50:56 prefix that are not part of the 'static'
	range.

	00:50:56 was used as prefix for generated MAC addresses, this is not possible
	anymore, because there are gaps in the allowed ranges. Therefore, change the
	prefix to 00:0c:29 which is the prefix for auto generated MAC addresses anyway.

	Allow arbitrary MAC addresses to be used and set the checkMACAddress VMX option
	to false in case the MAC address doesn't fall into any predefined range.

	* docs/drvesx.html.in: update website accordingly
	* src/esx/esx_driver.c: set the auto generation prefix to 00:0c:29

	esx: Don't warn about an empty URI path

	esx: Also allow virtualHW version 4 for ESX 4.0
	A domain with virtualHW version 4 is allowed on an ESX 4.0 server.
	If a domain is migrated from an ESX 3.5 server to an ESX 4.0 server
	then the virtualHW version stays the same. So a ESX 4.0 server can
	host domains with virtualHW version 4.

	Don't free an uninitalized pointer in update_driver_name()

	convert missing server entry points into unsupported errors
	If using a remote access, sometimes an RPC entry point is not
	available, and currently we just end up with a raw:
	    error: unknown procedure: xxx
	error, while this should be more cleanly reported as an unsupported
	entry point like for local access

	* src/remote/remote_driver.c: convert missing remote entry points into
	  the unsupported feature error

	fix some error report when on remote access
	When querying about a domain from 0.3.3 (or RHEL 5.3) domain located
	on a 0.6.3 (RHEL-5) machine, the errors are not properly reported.
	This patch from Olivier Fourdan <ofourdan@redhat.com> , slightly
	modified to not change the semantic when the domain os details cannot

	Fix undefined reference to 'close_used_without_including_unistd_h'
	Found while trying to cross-compile libvirt on Fedora 12 for Windows.
	gnulib redefines 'close' to 'close_used_without_including_unistd_h'
	in sys/socket.h if winsock2.h is present and unistd.h has not been
	included before sys/socket.h. Reorder some includes to fix this.

	Fix argument type of virProcessInfoSetAffinity dummy function

	Define ATTRIBUTE_SENTINEL for GCC < 4.0 too
	ATTRIBUTE_SENTINEL was defined for GCC >= 4.0 only, resulting in
	compile errors when using GCC < 4.0.

	Fix compilation  with configure --disable-nls

	cpu: Fix memory leaks in x86FeatureLoad and x86ModelLoad
	Also backup and restore the original ctxt->node value in x86FeatureLoad.

	Fix configure check for SASL
	The option --with-sasl defaults to 'check', but an inverted test logic
	lets the SASL check fail with an error instead of disabling SASL.
	Fix the test logic so SASL support gets disabled if SASL is missing and
	--with-sasl is set to check.

	Fix GnuTLS pkg-config check
	The testlogic for $PKG_CONFIG was inverted, checking for an empty string
	before using PKG_CHECK_MODULES. Use -x instead of -z and add an else branch
	to the if checking for $GNUTLS_FOUND = no to add -lgcrypt in case the
	GnuTLS libraries are detected by pkg-config.

	Make Xen VT-d PCI attach/detach work
	The Xen code for making HVM VT-d PCI passthrough attach and detach
	wasn't working properly:

	1)  In xenDaemonAttachDevice(), we were always trying to reconfigure
	a PCI passthrough device, even the first time we added it.  This was
	because the code in virDomainXMLDevID() was not checking xenstore for
	the existence of the device, and always returning 0 (meaning that
	the device already existed).

	2)  In xenDaemonDetachDevice(), we were trying to use "device_destroy"
	to detach a PCI device.  While you would think that is the right
	method to call, it's actually wrong for PCI devices.  In particular,
	in upstream Xen (and soon in RHEL-5 Xen), device_configure is actually
	used to destroy a PCI device.

	To fix the attach
	problem I add a lookup into xenstore to see if the device we are
	trying to attach already exists.  To fix the detach problem I change
	it so that for PCI detach (only), we use device_configure with the
	appropriate sxpr to do the detachment.

	* src/xen/xend_internal.c: don't use device_destroy for PCI devices
	  and fix the other issues.
	* src/xen/xs_internal.c src/xen/xs_internal.h: add
	  xenStoreDomainGetPCIID()

	Fix detection of JSON when restarting libvirtd
	The XML XPath for detecting JSON in the running VM statefile was
	wrong causing all VMs to get JSON mode enabled at libvirtd restart.

	In addition if a VM was running a JSON enabled QEMU once, and then
	altered to point to a non-JSON enabled QEMU later the 'monJSON'
	flag would not get reset to 0.

	Fix reporting of TLS connection errors
	The code for connecting to a server tries each socket in turn
	until it finds one that connects. Unfortunately for TLS sockets
	if it connected, but failed TLS handshake it would treat that

	python: Add python bindings for virDomainMemoryStats
	Enable virDomainMemoryStats in the python API.  dom.memoryStats() will return a
	dictionary containing the supported statistics.  A dictionary is required
	because the meaining of each quantity cannot be inferred from its index in a
	list.

	* python/generator.py: reenable bindings for this entry point
	* python/libvirt-override-api.xml python/libvirt-override.c: the
	  generator can't handle this new function, add the new binding,
	  and the XML description

	Add a new command dommemstats for virDomainMemoryStats
	Define a new command 'dommemstats' to report domain memory statistics.  The
	output format is inspired by 'domblkstat' and 'domifstat' and consists of
	tag/value pairs, one per line.  The command can complete successfully and
	print no output if virDomainMemoryStats is supported by the driver, but not
	the guest operating system.

	Sample output:
	swap_in 0
	swap_out 0
	major_fault 54
	minor_fault 58259
	unused 487680
	available 502472

	All stats referring to a quantity of memory (eg. all above except major and
	minor faults) represent the quantity in KBytes.

	* tools/virsh.c: implements the new command

	Add domainMemoryStats support to remote driver
	Use a dynamically sized xdr_array to pass memory stats on the wire.  This
	supports the addition of future memory stats and reduces the message size
	since only supported statistics are returned.

	* src/remote/remote_protocol.x: provide defines for the new entry point
	* src/remote/remote_driver.c daemon/remote.c: implement the client and
	  server side
	* daemon/remote_dispatch_args.h daemon/remote_dispatch_prototypes.h
	  daemon/remote_dispatch_ret.h daemon/remote_dispatch_table.h
	  src/remote/remote_protocol.c src/remote/remote_protocol.h: generated
	  stubs

	Implements domainMemStats in the qemu driver
	Support for memory statistics reporting is accepted for qemu inclusion.
	Statistics are reported via the monitor command 'info balloon' as a comma
	seprated list:

	(qemu) info balloon
	balloon: actual=1024,mem_swapped_in=0,mem_swapped_out=0,major_page_faults=88,minor_page_faults=105535,free_mem=1017065472,total_mem=1045229568

	Libvirt, qemu, and the guest operating system may support a subset of the
	statistics defined by the virtio spec.  Thus, only statistics recognized by
	components will be reported.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.[ch]: implement the
	  new entry point by using info balloon monitor command

	domMemoryStats: Add public symbol to libvirt API
	* src/libvirt.c: implement the main entry point
	* src/libvirt_public.syms: add it to the exported symbols

	Add new API virDomainMemoryStats to header and drivers
	Set up the types for the domainMemoryStats function and insert it into the
	virDriver structure definition.  Because of static initializers, update
	every driver and set the new field to NULL.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in: new API
	* src/driver.h src/*/*_driver.c src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c: add the new

	esx: Add more links to external documentation

	esx: Destroy virtual machine on a vCenter if available
	If a virtual machine is destroyed on a ESX server then immediately
	undefining this virtual machine on a vCenter may fail, because the
	vCenter has not been informed about the status change yet. Therefore,
	destroy a virtual machine on a vCenter if available, so the vCenter
	is up-to-date when the virtual machine should be undefined.

	esx: Undefine virtual machine on a vCenter if available
	Undefining a virtual machine on an ESX server leaves a orphan on the
	vCenter behind. So undefine a virtual machine on a vCenter if available
	to fix this problem.

	esx: Don't warn about '/' paths

	esx: Use occurrence enum to specify expected result of a SOAP call
	Also move XPath expression composition into esxVI_Context_Execute().

	esx: Fix occurence typo

	esx: Extend documentation about 'vcenter' and add some about 'auto_answer'

	esx: Extend vCenter query parameter
	If an ESX host is managed by a vCenter, it knows the IP address of the
	vCenter. Setting the vCenter query parameter to * allows to connect to the
	vCenter known to an ESX host without the need to specify its IP address
	or hostname explicitly.

	esx: Removed unused inttypes.h include

	esx: Replace libxml1 'xmlChildrenNode' with libxml2 'children'

	esx: Use more suitable error code in esxVI_LookupVirtualMachineByUuid()

	esx: Improve domain lookup by UUID
	esxDomainLookupByUUID() and esxDomainIsActive() lookup a domain by asking
	ESX for all known domains and searching manually for the one with the
	matching UUID. This is inefficient. The VI API allows to lookup by UUID
	directly: FindByUuid().

	* src/esx/esx_driver.c: change esxDomainLookupByUUID() and esxDomainIsActive()
	  to use esxVI_LookupVirtualMachineByUuid(), also reorder some functions to
	  keep them in sync with the driver struct

	esx: Add automatic question handling
	Questions can block tasks, to handle them automatically the driver can answers
	them with the default answer. The auto_answer query parameter allows to enable
	this automatic question handling.

	* src/esx/README: add a detailed explanation for automatic question handling
	* src/esx/esx_driver.c: add automatic question handling for all task related
	  driver functions
	* src/esx/esx_util.[ch]: add handling for the auto_answer query parameter
	* src/esx/esx_vi.[ch], src/esx/esx_vi_methods.[ch], src/esx/esx_vi_types.[ch]:
	  add new VI API methods and types and additional helper functions for
	  automatic question handling

	Fix compilation with gcrypt < 1.4.2
	Commit 33a198c1f6a4a1bc7f34d50a31032e03bec10fee increased the gcrypt
	version requirement to 1.4.2 because the GCRY_THREAD_OPTION_VERSION
	define was added in this version.

	The configure script doesn't check for the gcrypt version. To support
	gcrypt versions < 1.4.2 change the virTLSThreadImpl initialization
	to use GCRY_THREAD_OPTION_VERSION only if it's defined.

	Don't mix LDFLAGS and LIBS in the configure script
	* configure.in: If you pass libraries in the LDFLAGS variable, and then
	  try AC_CHECK_FUNCS to find whether a function is present or not,
	  it'll fail badly when using the --as-needed linker flag. Instead,
	  pass the libraries through the LIBS library, so that they are passed
	  after the conftest.c source file and the tests are done properly.

	Don't make it possible to define HAVE_HAL but not enable it in automake
	* configure.in: With the previous logic, if libhal_get_all_devices
	  function was not found, HAVE_HAL would be defined for the preprocessor
	  but it wouldn't be enabled in automake conditionals, causing the final
	  link to fail with missing references to HAL entries.

	Implement virsh command 'cpu-compare'
	* tools/virsh.c: provide a way to us teh new API with virsh

	Implement CPU selection in QEMU driver
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c src/qemu/qemu_conf.h src/qemu/qemu_driver.c:
	  add the new entry point, extend capabilities and code to interract
	  with qemu

	Adds CPU map for models and features
	* src/cpu/cpu_map.xml: newdescription file
	* src/Makefile.am: include it in dist

	Adds CPU selection infrastructure
	Each driver supporting CPU selection must fill in host CPU capabilities.
	When filling them, drivers for hypervisors running on the same node as
	libvirtd can use cpuNodeData() to obtain raw CPU data. Other drivers,
	such as VMware, need to implement their own way of getting such data.
	Raw data can be decoded into virCPUDefPtr using cpuDecode() function.

	When implementing virConnectCompareCPU(), a hypervisor driver can just
	call cpuCompareXML() function with host CPU capabilities.

	For each guest for which a driver supports selecting CPU models, it must
	set the appropriate feature in guest's capabilities:

	    virCapabilitiesAddGuestFeature(guest, "cpuselection", 1, 0)

	Actions needed when a domain is being created depend on whether the
	hypervisor understands raw CPU data (currently CPUID for i686, x86_64
	architectures) or symbolic names has to be used.

	Typical use by hypervisors which prefer CPUID (such as VMware and Xen):

	- convert guest CPU configuration from domain's XML into a set of raw
	  data structures each representing one of the feature policies:

	    cpuEncode(conn, architecture, guest_cpu_config,
	              &forced_data, &required_data, &optional_data,
	              &disabled_data, &forbidden_data)

	- create a mask or whatever the hypervisor expects to see and pass it
	  to the hypervisor

	Typical use by hypervisors with symbolic model names (such as QEMU):

	- get raw CPU data for a computed guest CPU:

	    cpuGuestData(conn, host_cpu, guest_cpu_config, &data)

	- decode raw data into virCPUDefPtr with a possible restriction on
	  allowed model names:

	    cpuDecode(conn, guest, data, n_allowed_models, allowed_models)

	- pass guest->model and guest->features to the hypervisor

	XML schema for CPU flags
	XML schema for CPU flags

	Firstly, CPU topology and model with optional features have to be
	advertised in host capabilities:

	    <host>
	        <cpu>
	            <arch>ARCHITECTURE</arch>
	            <features>
	                <!-- old-style features are here -->
	            </features>
	            <model>NAME</model>
	            <topology sockets="S" cores="C" threads="T"/>
	            <feature name="NAME"/>
	        </cpu>
	        ...
	    </host>

	Secondly, drivers which support detailed CPU specification have to
	advertise
	it in guest capabilities:

	    <guest>
	    ...
	    <features>
	            <cpuselection/>
	        </features>
	    </guest>

	And finally, CPU may be configured in domain XML configuration:

	<domain>
	    ...
	    <cpu match="MATCH">
	        <model>NAME</model>
	        <topology sockets="S" cores="C" threads="T"/>
	        <feature policy="POLICY" name="NAME"/>
	    </cpu>
	</domain>

	Where MATCH can be one of:
	    - 'minimum'     specified CPU is the minimum requested CPU
	    - 'exact'       disable all additional features provided by host CPU
	    - 'strict'      fail if host CPU doesn't exactly match

	POLICY can be one of:
	    - 'force'       turn on the feature, even if host doesn't have it
	    - 'require'     fail if host doesn't have the feature
	    - 'optional'    match host
	    - 'disable'     turn off the feature, even if host has it
	    - 'forbid'      fail if host has the feature

	'force' and 'disable' policies turn on/off the feature regardless of its
	availability on host. 'force' is unlikely to be used but its there for
	completeness since Xen and VMWare allow it.

	'require' and 'forbid' policies prevent a guest from being started on a host
	which doesn't/does have the feature. 'forbid' is for cases where you disable
	the feature but a guest may still try to access it anyway and you don't want
	it to succeed.

	'optional' policy sets the feature according to its availability on host.
	When a guest is booted on a host that has the feature and then migrated to
	another host, the policy changes to 'require' as we can't take the feature
	away from a running guest.

	Default policy for features provided by host CPU but not specified in domain
	configuration is set using match attribute of cpu tag. If 'minimum' match is
	requested, additional features will be treated as if they were specified
	with 'optional' policy. 'exact' match implies 'disable' policy and 'strict'
	match stands for 'forbid' policy.

	Initialize gcrypt threading
	GNUTLS uses gcrypt for its crypto functions. gcrypt requires
	that the app/library initializes threading before using it.
	We don't want to force apps using libvirt to know about
	gcrypt, so we make virInitialize init threading on their
	behalf. This location also ensures libvirtd has initialized
	it correctly. This initialization is required even if libvirt
	itself were only using one thread, since another non-libvirt
	library (eg GTK-VNC) could also be using gcrypt from another

	xm_internal.c: remove misleading dead code
	* src/xen/xm_internal.c (xenXMConfigGetULong): Remove useless and

	at that point, val->str is guaranteed to be non-NULL.

	qemu migration: avoid NULL-deref given an invalid input
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (doNonTunnelMigrate): Don't let a
	NULL "uri_out" provoke a NULL-dereference in doNativeMigrate:
	supply omitted goto-after-qemudReportError.

	qemu_driver.c: don't unlink(NULL) on OOM error path
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemudDomainMigratePrepareTunnel): Upon an
	out of memory error, we would end up with unixfile==NULL and attempt
	to unlink(NULL).  Skip the unlink when it's NULL.

	remote_driver.c: also zero out ->saslDecodedOffset member
	* src/remote/remote_driver.c (remoteIOReadMessage): ...rather than

	qemu_driver.c: avoid double free on error path
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemudDomainMigrateFinish2): Set

	failure does not cause a double free.

	libvirtd: avoid a NULL dereference on error path
	* daemon/libvirtd.c (qemudDispatchServer): Since "client" may be

	Fix install location for Python bindings
	Commit 66137344feb488ea87b0d92f3c03844d9a7a7786 changed the Python detection
	mechanism in configure to use AM_PATH_PYTHON. This results in a changed
	install location for the Python bindings, at least on Fedora 12 64bit systems.

	Before this commit libvirt.py and libvirtmod.so were installed to

	  /usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages

	After this commit they are installed to

	  /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages

	Mixed Python packages (containing *.py and *.so files) should be installed to
	the pyexecdir directory detected by AM_PATH_PYTHON.

	This restores the install location from before the AM_PATH_PYTHON commit.

	* configure.in: remove unnecessary pythondir export
	* python/Makefile.am: switch from pythondir to pyexecdir

	add --live support to "virsh dump"
	This is trivial for QEMU since you just have to not stop the vm before
	starting the dump.  And for Xen, you just pass the flag down to xend.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in (virDomainCoreDumpFlags): Add VIR_DUMP_LIVE.

	* tools/virsh.c (opts_dump): Add --live. (cmdDump): Map it to VIR_DUMP_LIVE.

	add --crash support to "virsh dump"
	This patch adds the --crash option (already present in "xm dump-core")
	to "virsh dump".  virDomainCoreDump already has a flags argument, so
	the API/ABI is untouched.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in (virDomainCoreDumpFlags): New flag for
	  CoreDump
	* src/test/test_driver.c (testDomainCoreDump): Do not crash
	  after dump unless VIR_DUMP_CRASH is given.
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemudDomainCoreDump): Shutdown the domain
	  instead of restarting it if --crash is passed.
	* src/xen/xend_internal.c (xenDaemonDomainCoreDump): Support --crash.
	* tools/virsh.c (opts_dump): Add --crash.
	  (cmdDump): Map it to flags for virDomainCoreDump and pass them.

2009-12-14  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Get QEMU pty paths from the monitor
	This change makes the QEMU driver get pty paths from the output of the
	monitor 'info chardev' command. This output is structured, and contains
	both the name of the device and the path on the same line. This is
	considerably more reliable than parsing the startup log output, which
	requires the parsing code to know which order QEMU will print pty
	information in.

	Note that we still need to parse the log output as the monitor itself
	may be on a pty. This should be rare, however, and the new code will
	replace all pty paths parsed by the log output method once the monitor
	is available.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.(c|h) src/qemu_monitor_text.(c|h): Implement
	  qemuMonitorGetPtyPaths().
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Get pty path information using

	retrieve paused/running state at migration start
	This patch fixes the bug where paused/running state is not
	transmitted during migration.  As a result, in the QEMU driver
	for example the machine was always started on the destination
	end.

	In order to do so, just read the state and if it is appropriate and
	set the VIR_MIGRATE_PAUSED flag.

	* src/libvirt.c (virDomainMigrateVersion1, virDomainMigrateVersion2):
	  Automatically add VIR_MIGRATE_PAUSED when appropriate.
	* src/xen/xend_internal.c (xenDaemonDomainMigratePerform): Give a nicer
	  error message when migration of paused domains is attempted.

	add virsh --suspend arg to migrate command
	This adds a new flag, VIR_MIGRATE_PAUSED, that mandates pausing
	the migrated VM before starting it.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in (virDomainMigrateFlags): Add VIR_MIGRATE_PAUSED.
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemudDomainMigrateFinish2): Handle VIR_MIGRATE_PAUSED.
	* tools/virsh.c (opts_migrate): Add --suspend. (cmdMigrate): Handle it.
	* tools/virsh.pod (migrate): Document it.

	fix migration of paused vms upon failure
	This makes a small change on the failed-migration path.  Up to now,
	all VMs that failed non-live migration after the "stop" command
	were restarted.  This must not be done when the VM was paused in
	the first place.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemudDomainMigratePerform): Do not restart
	  a paused VM that fails migration.  Set paused state after "stop",
	  reset it after failure.

	remove iptablesReloadRules() and related code
	We don't use this method of reloading rules anymore, so we can just
	kill the code.

	This simplifies things a lot because we no longer need to keep a
	table of the rules we've added.

	* src/util/iptables.c: kill iptablesReloadRules()

	remove all traces of lokkit support
	Long ago we tried to use Fedora's lokkit utility in order to register
	our iptables rules so that 'service iptables restart' would
	automatically load our rules.

	There was one fatal flaw - if the user had configured iptables without
	lokkit, then we would clobber that configuration by running lokkit.

	We quickly disabled lokkit support, but never removed it. Let's do
	that now.

	The 'my virtual network stops working when I restart iptables' still
	remains. For all the background on this saga, see:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/227011

	* src/util/iptables.c: remove lokkit support

	* configure.in: remove --enable-lokkit

	* libvirt.spec.in: remove the dirs used only for saving rules for lokkit

	* src/Makefile.am: ditto

	* src/libvirt_private.syms, src/network/bridge_driver.c,
	  src/util/iptables.h: remove references to iptablesSaveRules

	reload iptables rules on libvirtd restart
	This is the expected behaviour, I think - reloading libvirtd should
	be a subset of restarting it.

	Note, we reload the rules after we've determined which networks
	are active (because we only add the rules for active networks)
	and before we start autostart networks (to avoid re-adding the
	rules).

	* src/network/bridge_driver.c: reload iptables rules on startup

	reload iptables rules simply by re-adding them
	Currently, when we add iptables rules, we keep them on a list so that
	we can easily reload them on e.g. 'service libvirtd reload'.

	However, we don't save this list to disk, so if libvirtd is restarted
	we lose the ability to reload the rules.

	The fix is simple - just re-add the damn things on reload.

	Note, we delete the rules before re-adding them, just like the current
	behaviour of iptRulesReload().

	* src/network/bridge_driver.c: re-add the iptables rules on reload.

	Make QEMU text monitor parsing more robust
	The QEMU 0.10.0 release (and possibly other 0.10.x) has a bug where
	it sometimes/often forgets to display the initial monitor greeting
	line, soley printing a (qemu).  This in turn confuses the text
	console parsing because it has a '(qemu)' it is not expecting. The
	confusion results in a negative malloc. Bad things follow.

	This re-writes the text console handling to be more robust. The key
	idea is that it should only look for a (qemu), once it has seen the
	original command echo'd back. This ensures it'll skip the bogus stray
	(qemu) with broken QEMUs.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c: Add some (disabled) debug code
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c: Re-write way command replies
	  are detected

	Fix virDomainObj ref handling in QEMU driver
	Since the monitor I/O is processed out of band from the main
	thread(s) invoking monitor  commands, the virDomainObj may be
	deleted by the I/O thread. The qemuDomainObjBeginJob takes an
	extra reference to protect against final deletion, but this
	reference is released by the corresponding EndJob call. THus
	after the EndJob call it may not be valid to reference the
	virDomainObj any more. To allow callers to detect this, the
	EndJob call is changed to return the remaining reference count.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c: Make virDomainObjUnref return the
	  remaining reference count
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Avoid referencing virDomainObjPtr
	  after qemuDomainObjEndJob if it has been deleted.

2009-12-09  Matthias Bolte  <matthias.bolte@googlemail.com>

	Use AM_PATH_PYTHON and python-config to detect Python configuration
	Using AM_PATH_PYTHON solves the site-packages directory problem. At least
	in Ubuntu with Python 2.6 and later site-packages is renamed to dist-packages
	and site-packages is not part of sys.path anymore. So installing the libvirt
	Python bindings to site-packages renders them unusable, because they can be
	imported from there without manually including site-packages into sys.path.

	AM_PATH_PYTHON detects the correct site-packages/dist-packages directory.

	python-config --includes gives the correct include path for the Python header
	files. The old probing code stays there as fallback mechanism.

	* configure.in: use AM_PATH_PYTHON and python-config

	Switch over to passing a callback table to QEMU monitor
	With addition of events there will be alot of callbacks.
	To avoid having to add many APIs to register callbacks,

	* po/POTFILES.in: Add src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Hack to turn on QMP

	Introduce callbacks for serializing domain object private data to XML
	Now that drivers are using a private domain object state blob,
	the virDomainObjFormat/Parse methods are no longer able to
	directly serialize all neccessary state to/from XML. It is
	thus neccessary to introduce a pair of callbacks fo serializing
	private state.

	The code for serializing vCPU PIDs and the monitor device
	config can now move out of domain_conf.c and into the
	qemu_driver.c where they belong.

	* src/conf/capabilities.h: Add callbacks for serializing private
	  state to/from XML
	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h: Remove the
	  monitor, monitor_chr, monitorWatch, nvcpupids and vcpupids
	  fields from virDomainObjPtr. Remove code that serialized
	  those fields
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Export virXPathBoolean
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Add callbacks for serializing monitor
	  and vcpupid data to/from XML
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c: Pass monitor

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Pull code to start CPUs executing out
	  of qemudInitCpuAffinity()

	Add a 'format' arg to qemuMonitorChangeMedia() since JSON will support it
	The current QEMU disk media change does not support setting the
	disk format. The new JSON monitor will support this, so add an
	extra parameter to pass this info in

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Pass in disk format when changing media
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.h:
	  Add a 'format' arg to qemuMonitorChangeMedia()

	Fix migration cancellation for QEMU
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c: Add missing underscore in the
	  migrate_cancel monitor command impl

	Move qemuMonitorEscape + migrate status enum into shared monitor code
	The qemuMonitorEscape() method, and the VIR_ENUM for migration
	status will be needed by the JSON monitor too, so move that code
	into the shared qemu_monitor.c file instead of qemu_monitor_text.c

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h: Declare qemuMonitorMigrationStatus enum
	  and qemuMonitorEscapeArg and qemuMonitorEscapeShell methods
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c: Implement qemuMonitorMigrationStatus enum
	  and qemuMonitorEscapeArg and qemuMonitorEscapeShell methods
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c: Remove above methods/enum

	Fix crash when deleting monitor while a command is in progress
	If QEMU shuts down while we're in the middle of processing a
	monitor command, the monitor will be freed, and upon cleaning
	up we attempt to do  qemuMonitorUnlock(priv->mon) when priv->mon
	is NULL.

	To address this we introduce proper reference counting into
	the qemuMonitorPtr object, and hold an extra reference whenever
	executing a command.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Hold a reference on the monitor while
	  executing commands, and only NULL-ify the priv->mon field when
	  the last reference is released

	vbox: Use virIndexToDiskName() in vboxGenerateMediumName()

2009-12-05  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Tests for interface type/model configuration
	add a set of tests for Xen interface type and model configurations

2009-12-04  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Support for interface model='netfront'
	Xen HVM guests with PV drivers end up with two network interfaces for
	each configured interface. One of them being emulated by qemu and the
	other one paravirtual. As this might not be desirable, the attached
	patch provides a way for users to specify that only paravirtual network
	interface should be presented to the guest.

	The configuration was inspired by qemu/kvm driver, for which users can
	specify model='virtio' to use paravirtual network interface.

	The patch adds support for model='netfront' which results in
	type=netfront instead of type=ioemu (or nothing for newer xen versions)
	in guests native configuration. Xen's qemu ignores interfaces with
	type != ioemu and only paravirtual network device will be seen in the
	guest.

	Four possible configuration scenarios follow:

	- no model specified in domain's XML
	    - libvirt will behave like before this change; it will set
	      type=ioemu for HVM guests on xen host which is not newer than
	      XEND_CONFIG_MAX_VERS_NET_TYPE_IOEMU
	    - covered by existing tests

	- PV guest, any model
	    - no functional change, model is passed as is (and ignored by the
	      hypervisor)
	    - covered by existing tests (e.g., *-net-e1000.*)
	- HVM guest, model=netfront
	    - type is set to "netfront", model is not specified
	    - covered by new *-net-netfront.* tests

	- HVM guest, model != netfront
	    - type is set to "ioemu", model is passed as is
	    - covered by new *-net-ioemu.* tests

	The fourth scenario feels like a regression for xen newer than
	XEND_CONFIG_MAX_VERS_NET_TYPE_IOEMU as users who had a model specified
	in their guest's configuration won't see a paravirtual interface in
	their guests any more. On the other hand, the reason for specifying a
	model is most likely the fact that they want to use such model which
	implies emulated interface. Users of older xen won't be affected at all
	as their xen provides paravirtual interface regardless of the type used.

	Add virIndexToDiskName and fix mapping gap
	esxVMX_IndexToDiskName handles indices up to 701. This limit comes
	from a mapping gap in virDiskNameToIndex:

	  sdzy -> 700
	  sdzz -> 701
	  sdaaa -> 728
	  sdaab -> 729

	This line in virDiskNameToIndex causes this gap:

	  idx = (idx + i) * 26;

	Fixing it by altering this line to:

	  idx = (idx + (i < 1 ? 0 : 1)) * 26;

	Also add a new version of virIndexToDiskName that handles the inverse
	mapping for arbitrary indices.

	Fix event test timer checks on kernels with HZ=100
	On kernels with HZ=100, the resolution of sleeps in poll() is
	quite bad. Doing a precise check on the expiry time vs the
	current time will thus often thing the timer has not expired
	even though we're within 10ms of the expected expiry time. This
	then causes another pointless sleep in poll() for <10ms. Timers
	do not need to have such precise expiration, so we treat a timer
	as expired if it is within 20ms of the expected expiry time. This
	also fixes the eventtest.c test suite on kernels with HZ=100

	qemu-kvm needs -enable-kvm flag for VT optimization
	Recent qemu releases require command option '-enable-qemu' in order

	Fix formatting of XML for an inactive guest
	If the virDomainDefPtr object has an 'id' of -1, then forcably
	set the VIR_DOMAIN_XML_INACTIVE flag to ensure generated XML
	does not include any cruft from the previously running guest
	such as console PTY path, or VNC port.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c: Set VIR_DOMAIN_XML_INACTIVE if
	  def->id is -1. Replace checks for def->id == -1 with
	  check against flags & VIR_DOMAIN_XML_INACTIVE.

	Remove capng_lock() call when spawning LXC container init process
	The capng_lock() call sets the SECURE_NO_SETUID_FIXUP and SECURE_NOROOT
	bits on the process. This prevents the kernel granting capabilities to
	processes with an effective UID of 0, or with setuid programs. This is
	not actually what we want in the container init process. It should be
	allowed to run setuid processes & keep capabilities when root. All that
	is required is masking a handful of dangerous capabilities from the
	bounding set.

	* src/lxc/lxc_container.c: Remove bogus capng_lock() call.

	Fix initscript to check daemon pidfile
	The libvirtd initscript could get confused between the system and

2009-11-10  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Allow timeouts waiting for QEMU job lock
	Some monitor commands may take a very long time to complete. It is
	not desirable to block other incoming API calls forever. With this
	change, if an existing API call is holding the job lock, additional
	API calls will not wait forever. They will time out after a short
	period of time, allowing application to retry later.

	* include/libvirt/virterror.h, src/util/virterror.c: Add new
	  VIR_ERR_OPERATION_TIMEOUT error code
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Change to a timed condition variable
	  wait for acquiring the monitor job lock

	Release driver and domain lock when running monitor commands
	QEMU monitor commands may sleep for a prolonged period of time.
	If the virDomainObjPtr or qemu driver lock is held this will
	needlessly block execution of many other API calls. it also
	prevents asynchronous monitor events from being dispatched
	while a monitor command is executing, because deadlock will
	ensure.

	To resolve this, it is neccessary to release all locks while
	executing a monitor command. This change introduces a flag
	indicating that a monitor job is active, and a condition
	variable to synchronize access to this flag. This ensures that
	only a single thread can be making a state change or executing
	a monitor command at a time, while still allowing other API
	calls to be completed without blocking

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Release driver and domain lock when
	  running monitor commands. Re-add locking to disk passphrase
	  callback
	* src/qemu/THREADS.txt: Document threading rules

	Fully asynchronous monitor I/O processing
	Change the QEMU monitor file handle watch to poll for both
	read & write events, as well as EOF. All I/O to/from the
	QEMU monitor FD is now done in the event callback thread.

	When the QEMU driver needs to send a command, it puts the
	data to be sent into a qemuMonitorMessagePtr object instance,
	queues it for dispatch, and then goes to sleep on a condition
	variable. The event thread sends all the data, and then waits
	for the reply to arrive, putting the response / error data
	back into the qemuMonitorMessagePtr and notifying the condition
	variable.

	There is a temporary hack in the disk passphrase callback to
	avoid acquiring the domain lock.  This avoids a deadlock in
	the command processing, since the domain lock is still held
	when running monitor commands. The next commit will remove
	the locking when running commands & thus allow re-introduction
	of locking the disk passphrase callback

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Temporarily don't acquire lock in
	  disk passphrase callback. To be reverted in next commit
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h: Remove
	  raw I/O functions, and a generic qemuMonitorSend() for
	  invoking a command
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.h:
	  Remove all low level I/O, and use the new qemuMonitorSend()
	  API. Provide a qemuMonitorTextIOProcess() method for detecting
	  command/reply/prompt boundaries in the monitor data stream

	authentication failed.

	Add reference counting on virDomainObjPtr objects
	Add reference counting on the virDomainObjPtr objects. With the
	forthcoming asynchronous QEMU monitor, it will be neccessary to
	release the lock on virDomainObjPtr while waiting for a monitor
	command response. It is neccessary to ensure one thread can't
	delete a virDomainObjPtr while another is waiting. By introducing
	reference counting threads can make sure objects they are using
	are not accidentally deleted while unlocked.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h, src/conf/domain_conf.c: Add
	  virDomainObjRef/Unref APIs, remove virDomainObjFree
	* src/openvz/openvz_conf.c: replace call to virDomainObjFree
	  with virDomainObjUnref

	Locking of the qemuMonitorPtr object
	In preparation of the monitor I/O process becoming fully asynchronous,
	it is neccessary to ensure all access to internals of the qemuMonitorPtr
	object is protected by a mutex lock.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h: Add mutex for locking
	  monitor.
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Add locking around all monitor commands

	Wrap text mode monitor APIs, pass qemuMonitorPtr directly to APIs
	Change the QEMU driver to not directly invoke the text mode monitor
	APIs. Instead add a generic wrapper layer, which will eventually
	invoke either the text or JSON protocol code as needed. Pass an
	qemuMonitorPtr object into the monitor APIs instead of virDomainObjPtr
	to complete the de-coupling of the monitor impl from virDomainObj
	data structures

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Remove qemuDomainObjPrivate definition
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Add qemuDomainObjPrivate definition.
	  Pass qemuMonitorPtr into all monitor APIs instead of the
	  virDomainObjPtr instance.
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h: Add thin
	  wrappers for all qemuMonitorXXX command APIs, calling into
	  qemu_monitor_text.c/h
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.h:
	  Rename qemuMonitor -> qemuMonitorText & update to accept
	  qemuMonitorPtr instead of virDomainObjPtr

	Move encryption lookup back into qemu driver file
	Decouple the monitor code from the virDomainDefPtr structure
	by moving the disk encryption lookup code back into the
	qemu_driver.c file. Instead provide a function callback to
	the monitor code which can be invoked to retrieve encryption
	data as required.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Add findDomainDiskEncryption,
	  and findVolumeQcowPassphrase. Pass address of the method
	  findVolumeQcowPassphrase into qemuMonitorOpen()
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c: Associate a disk
	  encryption function callback with the qemuMonitorPtr
	  object.
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c: Remove findDomainDiskEncryption
	  and findVolumeQcowPassphrase.

	Make use of private data structure for monitor state
	Introduce a new qemuDomainObjPrivate object which is used to store
	the private QEMU specific data associated with each virDomainObjPtr
	instance. This contains a single member, an instance of the new
	qemuMonitorPtr object which encapsulates the QEMU monitor state.
	The internals of the latter are private to the qemu_monitor* files,
	not to be shown to qemu_driver.c

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Definition of qemuDomainObjPrivate.
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Register a functions for creating
	  and freeing qemuDomainObjPrivate instances with the domain
	  capabilities. Remove the qemudDispatchVMEvent() watch since
	  I/O watches are now handled by the monitor code itself. Pass
	  a new qemuHandleMonitorEOF() callback into qemuMonitorOpen
	  to allow notification when the monitor quits.
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h: Introduce
	  the 'qemuMonitor' object. Temporarily add new APIs
	  qemuMonitorWrite, qemuMonitorRead, qemuMonitorWaitForInput
	  to allow text based monitor impl to perform I/O.
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c: Call APIs for reading/writing
	  to monitor instead of accessing the file handle directly.

	Move code for low level QEMU monitor interaction into separate file
	The qemu_driver.c code should not contain any code that interacts
	with the QEMU monitor at a low level. A previous commit moved all
	the command invocations out. This change moves out the code which
	actually opens the monitor device.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Remove qemudOpenMonitor & methods called
	  from it.
	* src/Makefile.am: Add qemu_monitor.{c,h}
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h: Add qemuMonitorOpen()
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c: All code for opening the monitor

	Add a new timed condition variable wait API
	* src/util/threads.h, src/util/threads-pthread.c,

	Fix errno handling for pthreads wrappers
	* src/util/threads-pthread.c: pthreads APIs do not set errno, instead
	  the return value is the positive errno. Set errno based on the return
	  value in the wrappers

	Make pciDeviceList struct opaque
	* src/util/pci.c, src/util/pci.h: Make the pciDeviceList struct
	  opaque to callers of the API. Add accessor methods for managing
	  devices in the list
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Update to use APIs instead of directly
	  accessing pciDeviceList fields

	This is what virsh already expects when printing output, and what
	'man cpuset' claims to support.

	qemu: Use same create/define overwrite logic for migration prepare.

	qemu: Break out function to check if we can create/define/restore
	Use this function in the qemu, uml, lxc, and test drivers.

	Support for <channel> in domain and QEmu backend
	allows the following to be specified in a domain:
	<channel type='pipe'>
	  <source path='/tmp/guestfwd'/>
	  <target type='guestfwd' address='10.0.2.1' port='4600'/>
	</channel>

	* proxy/Makefile.am: add network.c as dep of domain_conf.c
	* docs/schemas/domain.rng src/conf/domain_conf.[ch]: extend the domain
	  schemas and the parsing/serialization side for the new construct

	QEmu support will add the following on the qemu command line:
	 -chardev pipe,id=channel0,path=/tmp/guestfwd
	 -net user,guestfwd=tcp:10.0.2.1:4600-chardev:channel0

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Add argument output for channel
	* tests/qemuxml2(argv|xml)test.c: Add test for <channel> domain syntax

	Detect availability of QEMU -chardev CLI option
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: defines a new QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_CHARDEV flag
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: parse the output for -chardev and set flag
	  appropriately

	Allow character devices to have different target types
	A character device's target (it's interface in the guest) had only a
	single property: port. This patch is in preparation for adding targets
	which require other properties.
	Since this changes the conf type for character devices this affects
	a number of drivers:

	* src/conf/domain_conf.[ch] src/esx/esx_vmx.c src/qemu/qemu_conf.c
	  src/qemu/qemu_driver.c src/uml/uml_conf.c src/uml/uml_driver.c
	  src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c src/xen/xend_internal.c src/xen/xm_internal.c:
	  target properties are moved into a union in virDomainChrDef, and a
	  targetType field is added to identify which union member should be
	  used. All current code which touches a virDomainChrDef is updated both
	  to use the new union field, and to populate targetType if necessary.

	LXC allow container to have ethN interfaces
	Current implementation of lxc driver creates vethN named
	interface(s) in the host and passes as it is to a container.
	The reason why it doesn't use ethN is due to the limitation
	that one namespace cannot have multiple iterfaces that have
	an identical name so that we give up creating ethN named
	interface in the host for the container.

	However, we should be able to allow the container to have
	ethN by changing the name after clone(CLONE_NEWNET).

	* src/lxc/lxc_container.c src/lxc/veth.c src/lxc/veth.h: do the clone
	  and then renames interfaces eth0 ... ethN to keep the interface names
	  familiar in the domain

	LXC cleanup deep indentation in lxcDomainSetAutostart
	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c: refactor lxcDomainSetAutostart() to avoid deep
	  indentation of the code

	LXC messages cleanup and fix lxcError
	* src/lxc/lxc_container.c src/lxc/lxc_controller.c src/lxc/lxc_driver.c
	  src/lxc/veth.c: most of cleanups are just capitalizing their messages
	  though, some fixes wrong error messages and awkward indentations, and
	  improves error messages.

	LXC fix wrong or out-of-date function descriptions
	* src/lxc/lxc_container.c src/lxc/lxc_controller.c src/lxc/lxc_driver.c
	  src/lxc/veth.c: fix broken function comments

	add MAC address based port filtering to qemu
	* src/qemu/qemu.conf src/qemu/qemu_conf.c src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: there is
	  a new config type option for mac filtering
	* src/qemu/qemu_bridge_filter.[ch]: new module for the ebtable entry points

	* src/Makefile.am po/POTFILES.in: add the new module

	New ebtables module wrapper
	* configure.in: look for ebtables binary location if present
	* src/Makefile.am: add the new module
	* src/util/ebtables.[ch]: new module and internal APIs around

	test: Implement virDomainPinVcpu

	test: Implement virDomainGetVcpus

	test: Update vcpu runtime info in SetVcpus

	test: Use privateData to track running VM vcpu state

	test: Break out wrapper for setting up started domain state.
	This should be a no op for now, but we will use this function to set up
	transient state in the future.

	test: Fixes for SetVcpus
	- Implement DomainGetMaxVCPUs
	- Use GetMaxVCPUs to validate requested CPU amount
	- Deny the 'hotplug' for a running domain.

	qemu: Remove compiled out localhost migration support
	Pretty sure this would deadlock now that we have proper locking, so
	remove the code.

	storage: conf: Fix memory leak in encryption parsing

	Various error reporting fixes
	- Don't duplicate SystemError
	- Use proper error code in domain_conf
	- Fix a broken error call in qemu_conf
	- Don't use VIR_ERR_ERROR in security driver (isn't a valid code in this case)

	Improve error reporting for virConnectGetHostname calls
	All drivers have copy + pasted inadequate error reporting which wraps
	util.c:virGetHostname. Move all error reporting to this function, and improve
	what we report.

	Changes from v1:
	  Drop the driver wrappers around virGetHostname. This means we still need
	  to keep the new conn argument to virGetHostname, but I think it's worth
	  it.

	Fix improper error return in virInterfaceDefParseProtoIPvX
	* src/conf/interface_conf.c: the code was erronously returning -1
	  in the two functions if <dhcp> is not provided

	Make monitor type (miimon/arpmon) optional in bond xml
	* src/conf/interface_conf.c: lack of one of these in the live xml output
	  was causing the parse in virInterfaceDefParseBond() to fail

	Fix virInterfaceIpDefPtr leak during virInterfaceIpDefFree
	* src/conf/interface_conf.c: forgot to free the structure itself

	Support for IPv6 / multiple addresses per interfaces
	This patch updates the xml parsing and formatting, and the associated
	virInterfaceDef data structure to support IPv6, along the way adding
	support for multiple protocols per interface, and multiple IP
	addresses per protocol.
	* src/conf/interface_conf.[ch]: update the structures, code for parsing
	  and serialization

	Support reporting live interface IP/netmask
	This patch adds the flag VIR_INTERFACE_XML_INACTIVE to
	virInterfaceGetXMLDesc's flags. When it is*not* set (the default), the
	live interface info will be returned in the XML (in particular, the IP
	address(es) and netmask(s) will be retrieved by querying the interface
	directly, rather than  reporting what's in the config file). The
	backend of this is in netcf's ncf_if_xml_state() function.

	* configure.in libvirt.spec.in: requires netcf >= 0.1.3
	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in: adds flag VIR_INTERFACE_XML_INACTIVE
	* src/conf/interface_conf.c src/interface/netcf_driver.c src/libvirt.c:
	  update the parsing and backend routines accordingly
	* tools/virsh.c: change interface edit to inactive definition and
	  adds the inactive flag for interface dump

	Make startmode optional in toplevel interface definition
	The minimal XML returned from ncf_if_xml_state() doesn't contain this
	attribute (which makes no sense in the case of reporting current
	status of the interface), and it was preventing it from passing
	through the parse/format step.

	* src/conf/interface_conf.[ch]: add a new virInterfaceStartMode value
	  and modify loading/saving accordingly

2009-11-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Move libvirtd event loop into background thread
	The virStateInitialize() call for starting up stateful drivers
	may require that the event loop is running already. This it is
	neccessary to start the event loop before this call. At the
	same time, network clients must not be processed until afte
	virStateInitialize has completed.

	The qemudListenUnix() and remoteListenTCP() methods must
	therefore not register file handle watches, merely open the
	network sockets & listen() on them. This means clients can
	connected and are queued, pending completion of initialization

	The qemudRunLoop() method is moved into a background thread
	that is started early to allow access to the event loop during
	driver initialization. The main process thread leader pretty
	much does nothing once the daemon is running, merely waits
	for the event loop thread to quit

	* daemon/libvirtd.c, daemon/libvirtd.h: Move event loop into
	  a background thread
	* daemon/THREADING.txt: Rewrite docs to better reflect reality

	Allow NULL mac address in virGetInterface
	There are places where an interface will not have a mac address, and netcf
	returns this as a NULL pointer rather than a pointer to an empty string.
	Rather than checking for this all over the place in libvirt, just save it
	in the virInterface object as an empty string.

	* src/datatypes.c: allow NULL mac in virGetInterface()

	Fix these up.

	Remove redundant virFileDeletePID() call
	qemudShutdownVMDaemon() calls qemudRemoveDomainStatus(), which
	then calls virFileDeletePID().  qemudShutdownVMDaemon() then
	unnecessarily calls virFileDeletePID() again.  Remove this second
	usage of it, and also slightly refactor qemudRemoveDomainStatus()
	to VIR_WARN appropriate error messages.

	Fix return value in virStateInitialize impl for LXC
	The LXC driver was mistakenly returning -1 for lxcStartup()
	in scenarios that are not an error. This caused the libvirtd
	to quit for unprivileged users. This fixes the return code
	of LXC driver, and also adds a "name" field to the virStateDriver
	struct and logging to make it easier to find these problems
	in the future

	* src/driver.h: Add a 'name' field to state driver to allow
	  easy identification during failures
	* src/libvirt.c: Log name of failed driver for virStateInit
	  failures
	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c: Don't return a failure code for
	  lxcStartup() if LXC is not available on this host, simply
	  disable the driver.

	ESX: Fix memory leak in list handling functions.
	If an error occurs between the allocation of an item and appending it
	to the list, the item leaks. Free such orphaned items in error cases.

	* src/esx/esx_vi.c: free orphaned items in error cases

	ESX: Don't automatically follow redirects.
	The default transport for the VI API is HTTPS. If the server redirects
	from HTTPS to HTTP the driver would silently follow that redirection.
	The user assumes to communicate with the server over a secure transport
	but isn't.

	This patch disables automatical redirection following. The driver reports
	an error if the server tries to redirect.

	* src/esx/esx_vi.c: refactor the call to curl_easy_perform() into a
	  function and do error handling there, disable automatical redirection
	  following for curl
	* src/esx/esx_vi.h: change the type of responseCode to int

	ESX: Unify naming of VI API utility and convenience functions.
	Unified function naming scheme:
	- 'lookup' functions query the ESX or vCenter for information
	- 'get' functions return information from a local object

	* src/esx/esx_driver.c, src/esx/esx_vi.[ch]: unify function naming

	ESX: Change disk selection for datastore detection.
	In order to register a new virtual machine the ESX driver needs to upload
	a VMX file to a datastore. Try to put this file beside the main VMDK file
	of the virtual machine. Change the disk selection for datastore detection
	to choose the first file-based harddisk instead of just the first disk.
	The first disk may be a CDROM disk and ISO images are normaly not located
	in the virtual machine's directory.

	* src/esx/esx_driver.c: change disk selection for datastore detection

	ESX: Fallback to the preliminary name if the datastore cannot be found.
	This allows to use domain-xml-from-native with VMX files that reference
	unavailable datastores.

	* src/esx/esx_vmx.c: fallback to the preliminary name if the datastore
	  cannot be found

	Fix --with-init-script configure option
	* configure.in daemon/Makefile.am: the --with-init-script configure

	  mixed use of init-script and init-scripts.

2009-11-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Don't let parent of daemon exit until basic initialization is done
	The daemonizing code lets the parent exit almost immediately. This
	means that it may think it has successfully started even when
	important failures occur like not being able to acquire the PID
	file. It also means network sockets are not yet open.

	To address this when daemonizing the parent passes an open pipe
	file descriptor to the child. The child does its basic initialization
	and then writes a status code to the pipe indicating either success,
	or failure. This ensures that when daemonizing, the parent does not
	exit until the pidfile is acquired & basic network sockets are open.

	Initialization of the libvirt drivers is still done asynchronously
	since this may take a very long time.

	* daemon/libvirtd.c: Force parent to stay around until basic config
	  file, pidfile & network socket init is completed

	Pull signal setup code out into separate method
	* daemon/libvirtd.c: Introduce a daemonSetupSignals() method
	  and put all signal handling code there
	* daemon/libvirtd.h: Add sigread/sigwrite to qemud_server type

	Fix duplicating logging of errors in libvirtd
	The libvirt default error handling callback will print all errors
	to stderr. The libvirtd default logging callback will do the same.
	Set a no-op error handling callback in libvirtd to prevent this
	duplication

	* daemon/libvirtd.c: Register a no-op error handling function

	Fix initialization order bugs
	virInitialize must be the first libvirt function called to ensure
	threads, error handling & random number generator are all setup.

	Move UNIX socket directory permissions change to place of use

	Misc cleanup to network socket init
	* daemon/libvirtd.c: Change qemudNetworkInit() so that it doesn't try
	to free its argument, leaving the caller todo cleanup as is normal
	practice. Add missing policykit cleanup to qemudCleanup, and remove
	server watch if set. Remove duplicated call to listen() on TCP sockets

	Annotate many methods with ATTRIBUTE_RETURN_CHECK & fix problems
	Nearly all of the methods in src/util/util.h have error codes that
	must be checked by the caller to correct detect & report failure.
	Add ATTRIBUTE_RETURN_CHECK to ensure compile time validation of
	this

	* daemon/libvirtd.c: Add explicit check on return value of virAsprintf
	* src/conf/domain_conf.c: Add missing check on virParseMacAddr return
	  value status & report error
	* src/network/bridge_driver.c: Add missing OOM check on virAsprintf
	  and report error
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Add missing check on virParseMacAddr return
	  value status & report error
	* src/security/security_selinux.c: Remove call to virRandomInitialize
	  that's done in libvirt.c already
	* src/storage/storage_backend_logical.c: Add check & log on virRun
	  return status
	* src/util/util.c: Add missing checks on virAsprintf/Run status
	* src/util/util.h: Annotate all methods with ATTRIBUTE_RETURN_CHECK
	  if they return an error status code
	* src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c: Add missing check on virParseMacAddr
	* src/xen/xm_internal.c: Add missing checks on virAsprintf
	* tests/qemuargv2xmltest.c: Remove bogus call to virRandomInitialize()

	Allow for a driver specific private data blob in virDomainObjPtr
	The virDomainObjPtr object stores state about a running domain.
	This object is shared across all drivers so it is not appropriate
	to include driver specific state here. This patch adds the ability
	to request a blob of private data per domain object instance. The
	driver must provide a allocator & deallocator for this purpose

	THis patch abuses the virCapabilitiesPtr structure for storing the
	allocator/deallocator callbacks, since it is already being abused
	for other internal things relating to parsing. This should be moved
	out into a separate object at some point.

	* src/conf/capabilities.h: Add privateDataAllocFunc and
	  privateDataFreeFunc fields
	* src/conf/domain_conf.c: Invoke the driver allocators / deallocators
	  when creating/freeing virDomainObjPtr instances.
	* src/conf/domain_conf.h: Pass virCapsPtr into virDomainAssignDef
	  to allow access to the driver specific allocator function
	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c, src/opennebula/one_driver.c,
	  src/openvz/openvz_driver.c, src/qemu/qemu_driver.c,
	  src/test/test_driver.c, src/uml/uml_driver.c: Update for
	  change in virDomainAssignDef contract

2009-10-29  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Convert virDomainObjListPtr to use a hash of domain objects
	The current virDomainObjListPtr object stores domain objects in
	an array. This means that to find a particular objects requires
	O(n) time, and more critically acquiring O(n) mutex locks.

	The new impl replaces the array with a virHashTable, keyed off
	UUID. Finding a object based on UUID is now O(1) time, and only
	requires a single mutex lock. Finding by name/id is unchanged
	in complexity.

	In changing this, all code which iterates over the array had
	to be updated to use a hash table iterator function callback.
	Several of the functions which were identically duplicating
	across all drivers were pulled into domain_conf.c

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h, src/conf/domain_conf.c: Change
	  virDomainObjListPtr to use virHashTable. Add a initializer
	  method virDomainObjListInit, and rename virDomainObjListFree
	  to virDomainObjListDeinit, since its not actually freeing
	  the container, only its contents. Also add some convenient
	  methods virDomainObjListGetInactiveNames,
	  virDomainObjListGetActiveIDs and virDomainObjListNumOfDomains
	  which can be used to implement the correspondingly named
	  public API entry points in drivers

	libvirt-devel should only require libvirt-client
	There's a long known issue where if you install libvirt in a guest,
	the default virtual network will conflict with the default virtual
	network in the host.

	That's one of the reasons we have the libvirt-client RPM - it allows
	you to install the client library without having the host side
	installed.

	Rich Jones points out that if you install libvirt-devel in a guest,
	then you get libvirtd installed and the network conflict:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/531200

	libvirt-devel should only require libvirt-client - e.g. nothing in
	the devel package pertains to anything in the libvirt RPM. The Fedora
	packaging guidelines say:

	  https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging/Guidelines#Devel_Packages

	  Devel packages must require the base package using a fully versioned
	  dependency ...

	But for all intents and purposes, libvirt-client is our base RPM.

	* libvirt.spec.in: make libvirt-devel require libvirt-client

	virterror: Add a missing 'break' for VIR_ERR_INVALID_SECRET

	qemu: migrate: Don't require manual URI to specify a port
	The xen driver will generate a migration port if only a hostname is passed
	in the optional migrate URI, so let's do the same in qemu.

	Fix p2p migration without a passed uri.

	qemu: Fix an error message in GetVcpus

	test: Support virStorageFindPoolSources
	The results are hardcoded into the test driver, no option to read from a
	testfile is implemented at this time.

	storage: Add ParseSourceString function for use with FindPoolSources.
	This will simplify adding FindPoolSources support to more pool backends in
	the future (as well as the test driver).

	storage: Break out function to add pool source to a SourceList.
	Similar in theory to *AssignDef type functions, this duplicate functionality
	will be used by an future FindPoolSources implementations.

	storage: Break out pool source parsing to a separate function.
	We need to parse a source XML block for FindPoolSources, so this is a step
	in sharing the parsing. The new storage pool XML 2 XML tests cover this area
	pretty well to ensure we aren't causing regressions.

2009-10-28  Paolo Bonzini  <pbonzini@redhat.com>

	Add support for an external TFTP boot server
	This patch adds an optional attribute to the <bootp> tag, that
	allows to specify a TFTP server address other than the address of
	the DHCP server itself.

	This can be used to forward the BOOTP settings of the host down to the
	guest.  This is something that configurations such as Xen's default
	network achieve naturally, but must be done manually for NAT.

	* docs/formatnetwork.html.in: Document new attribute.
	* docs/schemas/network.rng: Add it to schema.
	* src/conf/network_conf.h: Add it to struct.
	* src/conf/network_conf.c: Add it to parser and pretty printer.
	* src/network/bridge_driver.c: Put it in the dnsmasq command line.
	* tests/networkxml2xmlin/netboot-proxy-network.xml

	Fix problems in the Xen inotify driver.
	In xenInotifyXendDomainsDirLookup() the wrong UUID variable is used

	Add a new syntax-check rule for gethostname.
	We should always be using virGetHostname in place of
	gethostname; thus add in a new syntax-check rule to make
	sure no new uses creep in.

	Various syntax-check fixes.
	Make a pass over the syntax-check files, tightening up regex's,
	un-ignoring certain files, and cleaning things up.

	Tighten up nonreentrant syntax-check.
	We can slightly tighten up the regex's used to detect the use of
	nonreentrant functions.  We can also check src/util/virterror.c
	by modifying a comment; I think it's worth it to get the additional
	coverage.

	Replace a gethostname by virGetHostname in libvirtd.c

	Replace two strcmp() by STREQ() in qemu_driver.c

	Replace gethostname by virGetHostname in xend_internal.c

	Remove a completely bogus reference increment in the Xen driver.
	xenUnifiedDomainEventRegister() calls out to
	virDomainEventCallbackListAdd(), which increments the reference
	count on the connection.  That is fine, but then
	xenUnifiedDomainEventRegister() increments the usage count again,
	leading to a usage count leak.  Remove the increment in the xen
	register, and the UnrefConnect in the xen unregister.

	Add a default log_level to qemudSetLogging to remove a build warning.
	(original patch from Charles Duffy)

	Better error message when libvirtd fails to start.

2009-10-22  Matthias Bolte  <matthias.bolte@googlemail.com>

	Fix potential false-positive OOM error reporting.
	If no matching device was found (cap == NULL) then no strdup() call
	was made and *wwnn and *wwpn are untouched. Checking them for NULL
	in this situation may result in reporting an false-positive OOM error
	because *wwnn and *wwpn may be initialized to NULL by the caller.

	Only check *wwnn and *wwpn for NULL if a matching device was found
	(cap != NULL) and thus strdup() was called.

	* src/conf/node_device_conf.c: only report an OOM error if there
	  really is one

	  XPath type is of the wrong type (meaning the query passed didn't
	  evaluate to a node set and code must be fixed)

	Don't copy old machines from a domain which has none
	If the the qemu and kvm binaries are the same, we don't include machine
	types in the kvm domain info.

	However, the code which refreshes the machine types info from the
	previous capabilities structure first looks at the kvm domain's info,
	finds it matches and then copies the empty machine types list over
	for the top-level qemu domain.

	That doesn't make sense, we shouldn't copy an empty machin types list.

	Take domain type into account when looking up default machine
	If one has e.g.

	  <guest>
	    <os_type>hvm</os_type>
	    <arch name='x86_64'>
	      <wordsize>64</wordsize>
	      <emulator>/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64</emulator>
	      <machine>pc-0.11</machine>
	      <machine canonical='pc-0.11'>pc</machine>
	      <machine>pc-0.10</machine>
	      <machine>isapc</machine>
	      <domain type='qemu'>
	      </domain>
	      <domain type='kvm'>
	        <emulator>/usr/bin/kvm</emulator>
	        <machine>pc</machine>
	        <machine>isapc</machine>
	      </domain>
	    </arch>
	  </guest>

	and start a guest with:

	  <domain type='kvm'>
	    ...
	    <os>
	      <type arch='x86_64'>hvm</type>
	      ...
	    </os>
	  </domain>

	then the default machine type should be 'pc' and not 'pc-0.11'

	Issue was reported by Anton Protopopov.

	* src/capabilities.[ch]: pass the domain type to
	  virCapabilitiesDefaultGuestArch() and use it to look up the default
	  machine type from a specific guest domain if needed.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/xen/xm_internal.c: update

	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-machine-aliases2.xml: update
	  the domain type to 'kvm' and remove the machine type to check
	  that the default gets looked up correctly

	Fix schema to allow missing machine type
	The domain/os/type element may have an arch specified without having
	a machine variant specified. In fact, this is what python-virtinst
	does when defining a guest.

	* docs/schemas/domain.rng: allow missing machine type

2009-10-09  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Rewrite example domain events programm for python
	The existing python demo for domain events does not fully
	implement the event loop contract. This makes the code useless
	for real world applications. This change re-writes the demo so
	that it has a full event loop implementation which is suitable
	for application usage & better demonstrates integration

	* examples/domain-events/events-python/event-test.py: Rewrite
	  to include a real world usable event loop implementation

	Remove some auto-generated files
	Removes some auto-generated files still under version control.
	It also moves the rule for generating NEWS into the Makefile.am
	that's in the same directory as the output file to avoid confusion

	* docs/libvirt-api.xml, docs/libvirt-refs.xml, NEWS: Remove
	  auto-generated files from source control
	* Makefile.am: Add rule for generating NEWS file
	* docs/Makefile.am: Remove rule for generating NEWS file

	Support a new peer-to-peer migration mode & public API
	Introduces several new public API options for migration

	 - VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER: With this flag the client only
	   invokes the virDomainMigratePerform method, expecting
	   the source host driver to do whatever is required to
	   complete the entire migration process.
	 - VIR_MIGRATE_TUNNELLED: With this flag the actual data
	   for migration will be tunnelled over the libvirtd RPC
	   channel. This requires that VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER is
	   also set.
	 - virDomainMigrateToURI: This is variant of the existing
	   virDomainMigrate method which does not require any
	   virConnectPtr for the destination host. Given suitable
	   driver support, this allows for all the same modes as
	   virDomainMigrate()

	The URI for VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER must be a valid libvirt
	URI. For non-p2p migration a hypervisor specific migration
	URI is used.

	virDomainMigrateToURI without a PEER2PEER flag is only
	support for Xen currently, and it involves XenD talking
	directly to XenD, no libvirtd involved at all.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in: Add VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER
	  flag for migration
	* src/libvirt_internal.h: Add feature flags for peer to
	  peer migration (VIR_FEATURE_MIGRATE_P2P) and direct
	  migration (VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER mode)
	* src/libvirt.c: Implement support for VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER
	  and virDomainMigrateToURI APIs.
	* src/xen/xen_driver.c: Advertise support for DIRECT migration
	* src/xen/xend_internal.c: Add TODO item for p2p migration
	* src/libvirt_public.syms: Export virDomainMigrateToURI
	  method
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Add support for PEER2PEER and
	  migration, and adapt TUNNELLED migration.
	* tools/virsh.c: Add --p2p and --direct args and use the
	  new virDomainMigrateToURI method where possible.

	Re-arrange doTunnelMigrate to simplify cleanup code
	Re-arrange the doTunnelMigrate method putting all non-QEMU local
	state setup steps first. This maximises chances of success before
	then starting destination QEMU for receiving incoming migration.
	Altogether this can reduce the number of goto cleanup labels to
	something more managable.

	* qemu/qemu_driver.c: Re-order steps in doTunnelMigrate

	Separate out code for sending tunnelled data
	Simplify the doTunnelMigrate code by pulling out the code for
	sending all tunnelled data into separate helper

	* qemu/qemu_driver.c: introduce doTunnelSendAll() method

	Pull connection handling code out of doTunnelMigrate
	Simplify the doTunnelMigrate() method by pulling out the code
	which opens/closes the virConnectPtr  object into a parent
	method

	* qemu/qemu_driver.c: Add doPeer2PeerMigrate which then calls
	  doTunnelMigrate with dconn & dom_xml

	Fix stream abort upon I/O failure during migration
	virStreamAbort is needed when the caller wishes to terminate
	the stream early, not when virStreamSend fails.

	* qemu/qemu_driver.c: Fix calling of virStreamAbort during
	  tunnelled migration

	Refactor native QEMU migration code
	The code for tunnelled migration was added in a dedicated method,
	but the native migration code is still inline in the top level
	qemudDomainMigratePerform() API. Move the native code out into
	a dedicated method too to make things more maintainable.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Pull code for performing a native
	  QEMU migration out into separate method

	Don't force dconn to be NULL in virDomainMigrate
	The code for tunnelled migration wierdly required the app to pass
	a  NULL 'dconn' parameter, only to have to use virConnectOpen
	itself shortly thereafter to get a 'dconn' object. Remove this
	bogus check & require the app to always pas 'dconn' as before

	* src/libvirt.c: Require 'dconn' for virDomainMigrate calls again
	  and remove call to virConnectOpen

	Remove unneccessary uri_in parameter from virMigratePrepareTunnel
	Since virMigratePrepareTunnel() is used for migration over the
	native libvirt connection, there is never any need to pass the
	target URI to this method.

	* daemon/remote.c, src/driver.h, src/libvirt.c, src/libvirt_internal.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_driver.c, src/remote/remote_driver.c,
	  src/remote/remote_protocol.c, src/remote/remote_protocol.h,
	  src/remote/remote_protocol.x: Remove 'uri_in' parameter from
	  virMigratePrepareTunnel() method

	Move the VIR_DRV_FEATURE* constants
	Move the VIR_DRV_FEATURE* constants into libvirt_internal.h
	since these flags are indicating whether  APIs in the
	libvirt_internal.h file are supported by a driver

	* src/driver.h: Remove VIR_DRV_FEATURE* constants
	* src/libvirt_internal.h: Add VIR_DRV_FEATURE* constants, using
	  an enum instead of #define
	* src/internal.h: pull in libvirt_internal.h

	Fix configure.ac message vertical alignment
	* configure.in: Align messages in configuration summary

	  log output configuration. This provides a way to have libvirtd and its
	  children log to a single file.  The default is to log to the container
	  log file.
	* src/Makefile.am libvirt.spec.in: add the new file
	* src/lxc/lxc_conf.[ch] src/lxc/lxc_driver.c: read the new log value
	  from the configuration file and pass the log informations when
	  starting up a container.

	LXC do not truncate container log files on restart
	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c: use O_APPEND instead of O_TRUNC when opening
	  the log file on lxcVmStart()

	LXC initialize logging configuration
	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c src/lxc/lxc_controller.c: before launching the
	  lxc controller, have the lxc driver query the log settings and setup
	  envp[]. This provides the advantage of honoring the actual log
	  configuration instead of only what had been set in the environment.
	  The lxc controller now simply has to call virLogSetFromEnv().

	Add debug for envp[] in virExecWithHook()
	* src/util/util.c: output some debug if caller of virExecWithHook have
	  set envp[]

	Add accessors for logging filters and outputs
	When configuring logging settings, keep more information about the
	output destination. Add accessors to retrieve the filter and output
	settings in the original string form; this to be used to set up
	environment for a child process that also logs.

	* src/util/logging.[ch]: add virLogGetFilters and virLogGetOutputs
	  accessors and modify the internals (including virLogDefineOutput())
	  to save the data needed for the accessors

	Add virFileAbsPath() utility
	* src/util/util.[ch]: Add virFileAbsPath() function to ensure an
	  absolute path for a potentially realtive path.
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: add it in libvirt private symbols

	Fix handling return value of qemuMonitorSetBalloon
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: The positive return value of
	  qemuMonitorSetBalloon should be handled as a success

	LXC implement memory control APIs
	The patch implements the missing memory control APIs for lxc, i.e.,
	domainGetMaxMemory, domainSetMaxMemory, domainSetMemory, and improves
	domainGetInfo to return proper amount of used memory via cgroup.

	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Export virCgroupGetMemoryUsage
	  and add missing virCgroupSetMemory
	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c: Implement missing memory functions
	* src/util/cgroup.c, src/util/cgroup.h: Add the function

	Add a domain argument to SVirt *RestoreImageLabel
	When James Morris originally submitted his sVirt patches (as seen in
	libvirt 0.6.1), he did not require on disk labelling for
	virSecurityDomainRestoreImageLabel. A later commit[2] changed this
	behavior to assume on disk labelling, which halts implementations for
	path-based MAC systems such as AppArmor and TOMOYO where
	vm->def->seclabel is required to obtain the label.

	* src/security/security_driver.h src/qemu/qemu_driver.c
	  src/security/security_selinux.c: adds the 'virDomainObjPtr vm'
	  argument back to *RestoreImageLabel

2009-10-07  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Fix up "make check"
	While running make check, I noticed that it was actually using
	the virsh binary from my system, in /usr/bin/virsh, and not the
	one that was just compiled.  This is actually caused by a bug
	in Makefile.am, where we didn't update the PATH to include tools.

	While here, I also updated all of the scripts to properly define
	the srcdir, abs_top_srcdir, and abs_top_builddir environment
	variables.  This is required if you want to be able to run the
	tests standalone (i.e. ./test instead of from make check).  I've
	tested this on both RHEL-5 and Fedora-10 machines, and make check
	works on both, as does running the individual tests by hand.

	  error: found error in /var/log/libvirt/qemu/*.log /var/log/libvirt/uml/*.log /var/log/libvirt/lxc/*.log , skipping

	* qemud/Makefile.am: always create /var/log/libvirt/{lxc,uml} when
	  installing the logrotate conf; not ideal, but easier than making
	  the logrotate conf depend on which drivers are enabled

2009-10-06  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix rebuilding of devhelp files
	The devhelp/ directory files depend on libvirt-api.xml being
	uptodate, but automake always processes SUBDIRS before the
	current directory. So devhelp would be built and then the
	libvirt-api.xml re-build, invalidating the devhelp data again.

	To fix this all the rules for devhelp are moved directly
	into the docs/Makefile.am allowing make to see the global
	dependancy chain and thus build things in the correct order

	* docs/Makefile.am: Add rules for devhelp rebuild
	* docs/devhelp/Makefile.am: Remove devhelp rebuild
	* configure.in: Remove docs/devhelp/Makefile.am

	Fix ordering of <exports> in API description file
	* docs/apibuild.py: Make uniq() function sort keys before returning

	test: Support loading node device info from file/XML
	Also add some XML examples.

	node conf: Make parsing routines consistent with other drivers
	Add virNodeDeviceParseFile, and make virNodeDeviceParseNode non-static. These

	test: Implement node device driver.
	Add a simple 'computer' device for the default driver. Only implement

	Throw error in GetBridgeName if net has no bridge.

	python: Add a newline after custom classes
	In the generated bindings, custom classes are squashed against the following

	python: Fix generated virInterface method names
	A mistake in the generator was causing virInterface methods to be generated
	with unpredicatable names ('ceUndefine', instead of just 'undefine'). This
	fixes the method names to match existing convention.

	Does anyone care if we are breaking API compat? My guess is that no one is
	using the python interface bindings yet.

	python: Use a pure python implementation of 'vir*GetConnect'
	The API docs explictly warn that we shouldn't use the C vir*GetConnect calls
	in bindings: doing so can close the internal connection pointer and cause
	things to get screwy. Implement these calls in python.

	python: Don't generate bindings for vir*Ref
	They are only for use in implementing the bindings, so shouldn't be
	exposed to regular API users.

	python: Don't generate conflicting conn.createXML functions.
	A special case in the generator wasn't doing its job, and duplicate
	conn.createXML functions were being generated. The bindings diff is:

	Fix memory leaks in libvirtd's message processing
	Commit 47cab734995fa9521b1df05d37e9978eedd8d3a2 changed the way how
	qemud_client_message objects were reused. Before this commit
	remoteDispatchClientRequest() reused the received message for normal responses
	and to report non-fatal errors. If a fatal error occurred qemudWorker() frees
	the message. After this commit non-fatal errors are reported by
	remoteSerializeReplyError() using a new qemud_client_message object and the
	original message leaks.

	To fix this leak the original message has to be freed if
	remoteSerializeReplyError() succeeds. If remoteSerializeReplyError()
	fails the original message is freed in qemudWorker().

	* daemon/dispatch.c: free qemud_client_message objects that will not be reused
	  and would leak otherwise, also free the allocated qemud_client_message object
	  in remoteSerializeError() if an error occurs

	* src/remote/remote_protocol.h: Regenerate
	* daemon/dispatch.c: Remove assumption that a error message
	  sent to client is always type=REMOTE_REPLY. It may now

	* daemon/qemud.h: Add struct qemud_client_stream for tracking
	  active data streams for clients. Tweak filter function
	  operation so that it accepts a client object too.
	* daemon/qemud.c: Refactor code for free'ing message objects
	  which have been fully transmitted into separate method.
	  Release all active streams when client shuts down. Change
	  filter function to be responsible for queueing the message

	Add public API definition for data stream handling
	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in: Public API contract for

	network: add 'bootp' and 'tftp' config
	Currently, libvirtd will start a dnsmasq process for the virtual
	network, but (aside from killing the dnsmasq process and replacing it),
	there's no way to define tftp boot options.

	This change introduces the appropriate tags to the dhcp configuration:

	 <network>
	   <name>default</name>
	   <bridge name="virbr%d" />
	   <forward/>
	   <ip address="192.168.122.1" netmask="255.255.255.0">
	     <tftp root="/var/lib/tftproot" />
	     <dhcp>
	       <range start="192.168.122.2" end="192.168.122.254" />
	       <bootp file="pxeboot.img"/>
	     </dhcp>
	   </ip>
	 </network>

	When the attributes are present, these are passed to the
	arguments to dnsmasq:

	 dnsmasq [...] --enable-tftp --tftp-root /srv/tftp --dhcp-boot pxeboot.img
	               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	                      from <tftp />                     from <bootp />

	At present, only local tftp servers are supported (ie, dnsmasq runs as
	the tftp server), but we could improve this in future by adding a
	server= attribute.

	Introduce virStrncpy.
	Add the virStrncpy function, which takes a dst string, source string,
	the number of bytes to copy and the number of bytes available in the
	dest string.  If the source string is too large to fit into the
	destination string, including the \0 byte, then no data is copied and
	the function returns NULL.  Otherwise, this function copies n bytes
	from source into dst, including the \0, and returns a pointer to the
	dst string.  This function is intended to replace all unsafe uses
	of strncpy in the code base, since strncpy does *not* guarantee that
	the buffer terminates with a \0.

	Fix xen driver refcounting.
	The commit cb51aa48a777ddae6997faa9f28350cb62655ffd "Fix up connection
	reference counting." changed the driver closing and virConnectPtr
	unref-logic in virConnectClose().

	Before this commit virConnectClose() closed all drivers of the given
	virConnectPtr and virUnrefConnect()'ed it afterwards. After this
	commit the driver-closing is done in virUnrefConnect() if and only if
	the ref-count of the virConnectPtr dropped to zero.

	This change in execution order leads to a virConnectPtr leak, at least
	for connections to Xen.

	The relevant call sequences:

	virConnectOpen() -> xenUnifiedOpen() ...

	... xenInotifyOpen() -> virConnectRef(conn)

	... xenStoreOpen() -> xenStoreAddWatch() -> conn->refs++

	virConnectClose() -> xenUnifiedClose() ...

	... xenInotifyClose() -> virUnrefConnect(conn)

	... xenStoreClose() -> xenStoreRemoveWatch() -> virUnrefConnect(conn)

	Before the commit this additional virConnectRef/virUnrefConnect calls
	where no problem, because virConnectClose() closed the drivers
	explicitly and the additional refs added by the Xen subdrivers were
	removed properly. After the commit this additional refs result in a
	virConnectPtr leak (including a leak of the hypercall file handle;
	that's how I noticed this problem), because now the drivers are only
	close if and only if the ref-count drops to zero, but this cannot
	happen anymore, because the additional refs from the Xen subdrivers
	would only be removed if the drivers get closed, but that doesn't
	happen because the ref-count cannot drop to zero.

	The fix for this problem is simple: remove the
	virConnectRef/virUnrefConnect calls from the Xen subdrivers (see
	attached patch). Maybe someone could explain why the Xen Inotify and
	Xen Store driver do this extra ref-counting, but none of the other Xen
	subdrivers. It seems unnecessary to me and can be removed without
	problems.

	creating a qcow or qcow2-formatted volume, change the format to "qcow"
	and generate a secret as described above.

	  <encryption> when creating a qcow-formatted encrypted volume and the
	  user did not supply the information.

	Add virsh commands for secrets APIs
	* src/virsh.c: Add virsh commands.
	* docs/virsh.pod, virsh.1: Update documentation.

	Local file implementation of secret driver API
	This implementation stores the secrets in an unencrypted text file,
	for simplicity in implementation and debugging.

	(Symmetric encryption, e.g. using gpgme, will not be difficult to add.
	Because the TLS private key used by libvirtd is stored unencrypted,
	encrypting the secrets file does not currently provide much additional
	security.)

	* include/libvirt/virterror.h, src/virterror.c (VIR_ERR_NO_SECRET): New
	  error number.

	* qemud/qemud.c (qemudInitialize): Use the local secret driver.

	Add an internal <secret> XML handling API
	Add a <secret> XML handling API, separate from the local driver, to
	avoid manually generating XML in other parts of libvirt.

	* src/secret_conf.c, src/secret_conf.h: New files.
	* po/POTFILES.in, src/Makefile.am: Add secret_conf.

	Mask out flags used internally for virSecretGetValue
	Add a VIR_SECRET_GET_VALUE_INTERNAL_CALL flag value, replacing the
	originally separate libvirt_internal_call parameter.  The flag is used
	to differentiate external virSecretGetValue() calls from internal calls
	by libvirt drivers that need to use the secret even if it is private.

	* src/libvirt_internal.h Remove VIR_DOMAIN_XML_FLAGS_MASK
	* src/driver.h Add VIR_SECRET_GET_VALUE_FLAGS_MASK constant and
	  VIR_SECRET_GET_VALUE_INTERNAL_CALL. Re-add the
	  VIR_DOMAIN_XML_FLAGS_MASK constant
	* src/libvirt.c (virSecretGetValue): Don't allow the user to specify
	  internal flags.

	The interface allows qemudMonitorSendCont() to report errors that are
	not overridden by its callers.

	Also fix a potential infinite loop in qemuDomainCoreDump() if sending
	cont repeatedly fails.

	* src/qemu_driver.c (qemudMonitorSendCont): New function.
	  (qemudAutostartConfigs): Reset error before each call to
	  qemudStartVMDaemon().
	  (qemudInitCpus, qemudDomainResume, qemudDomainCoreDump,

2009-09-10  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Test that domain-specific qemu machine types are used correctly
	* tests/testutilsqemu.c: add a machine types list for /usr/bin/kvm
	  which doesn't have any aliases, while the guest has aliases

	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-machine-aliases2.*,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c: add a test using /usr/bin/kvm and make
	  sure that 'pc' machine type doesn't get canonicalized using the
	  aliases in the guest machine type list

	Simplify and fix qemudCanonicalizeMachine()
	The algorithm is quite simple:

	  If the emulator matches a guest's domain:
	    if domain has machine type info:
	      check the domain's machine type info
	    else
	      check the guest's default machine type info
	  else if the emulator matches the guest's default emulator:
	     check the guest's default machine type info

	The previous implementation was incorrectly falling back to the default
	machine type info if the domain's machine type info didn't have an
	alias.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: simplify and fix qemudCanonicalizeMachine()

	Probe machine types from kvm binary too
	Currently we only probe the main qemu binary for machine types, but we
	should also probe the kvm binary.

	* src/qemu_conf.c: probe kvm binary machines in qemudCapsInitGuest()

	Look up machine types from all domains in qemudGetOldMachines()
	Rather than just looking at the default domain info, look at all
	domains

	* src/qemu_conf.c: look at all domains in qemudGetOldMachines()

	Split up qemudGetOldMachines()
	We need to look at all the domain infos in guest capabilities, not
	just the defaults.

	In order to allow that, split out a qemudGetOldMachinesFromInfo()
	from qemudGetOldMachines(). We'll make more use of it in the next
	patch.

	* src/qemu_conf.c: split out qemudGetOldMachinesFromInfo() from
	  qemudGetOldMachines()

	Test qemu machine aliases
	* tests/testutilsqemu.c: make 'pc' an alias for qemu-system-x86_64

	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-machine-aliases1.*,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c: add a test which uses qemu-system-x86_64
	  and make sure the machine type is canonicalized.

	Re-factor qemu test machine allocation code
	* test/testutilsqemu.c: split out code to testQemuAllocMachines()
	  and make use of the ARRAY_CARDINALITY macro

	Canonicalize the qemu machine type in qemuxml2argvtest
	This doesn't have any affect on the current tests because we don't have
	any machine aliases in the current test data.

	* src/qemu_conf.h, src/qemu_driver.c: expose qemudCanonicalizeMachine()
	  for the tests

	* tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c: canonicalize the machine type

	Dump qemu driver capabilities if test debugging enabled
	* src/testutils.[ch]: make testDebug externally available

	* src/testutilsqemu.c: if VIR_TEST_DEBUG is set, dump the qemu
	  driver capabilities to stderr

	Fix formatting of machine types in capabilities XML
	* src/capabilities.c: fix machine type formatting in
	  virCapabilitiesFormatXML()

	Add qemu -help test data for qemu-kvm-0.11.0-rc2
	* tests/qemuhelpdata/qemu-kvm-0.11.0-rc2: add data

	* tests/qemuhelptest.c: add expected output

	Add a more featureful qemu capabilities test data
	Things added include

	  - x86_64 host
	  - Migration features
	  - NUMA topology
	  - Security model
	  - Canonical machine types
	  - Domain machine types
	  - An arm guest
	  - More machine types for mips, mipsel, sparc and ppc
	  - An x86_64 xenner guest

	This file was generated on a Fedora 12 machine using latest libvirt
	and qemu-kvm-0.11.0-rc2

	* tests/capabilityschemadata/caps-qemu-kvm.xml: add more features
	  to test

	Add arm arch to capabilities schema
	* docs/schemas/capabilities.rng: add arm and sort arches

	Update capabilities schema to allow multiple machines per domain
	* docs/schemas/capabilities.rng: allow multiple machines per domain
	  just like they are allowed for guests

	Add esx and tcp migration uri transports to capabilities schema
	* docs/schemas/capabilities.rng: include esx and tcp uri_transport

2009-09-10  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Fix regression from "Avoid polling on FDs with no events"
	After the mentioned patch was applied, I noticed that
	shutting down a kvm guest from inside (i.e. poweroff) caused
	the guest to shutdown, but not removed from the list of
	active guests.  DanB pointed out that the problem is that
	the virEventAddHandle() call in the qemu driver was asking
	to watch for 0 events, not HANGUP | ERROR as it should.  Add
	these events so that shutdown works again.

	Reintroduce support for lzop compression
	lzop was removed due to some confusion over whether it provided functional
	advantages distinct from xz. This has been addressed in the mailing list post
	archived at http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.libvirt/16487, and
	support for lzop is re-added here.

	* libvirt.spec.in: add dependancy on lzop
	* src/qemu.conf: update documentation of save_image_format
	* src/qemu_driver.c: re-add lzop compression option

2009-09-09  Daniel Veillard  <veillard@redhat.com>

	Fix bugs in virDomainMigrate v2 code.
	Paolo Bonzini points out that in my refactoring of the code for
	virDomainMigrate(), I added a check for the return value from
	virDomainMigratePerform().  The problem is that we don't want to
	exit if we fail, we actually want to go on and do
	virDomainMigrateFinish2() with a non-0 return code to clean things
	up.  Remove the check.

	While reproducing this issue, I also noticed that we wouldn't
	always properly propagate an error message.  In particular, I
	found that if you blocked off the migration ports (with iptables)
	and then tried the migration, it would actually fail but we would
	get no failure output from Qemu.  Therefore, we would think we
	succeeded, and leave a huge mess behind us.  Execute the monitor
	command "info migrate", and look for a failure string in there
	as well.

	Curiously, qemu-img does not need the passphrase for anything to create

	Note that partial encryption information (e.g. specifying an encryption
	format, but not the key/passphrase) is valid, libvirt will automatically
	choose value for the missing information during volume creation.  The
	user can read the volume XML, and use the unmodified <encryption> tag in

	Add volume encryption information handling.
	Define an <encryption> tag specifying volume encryption format and

	Currently the only defined parameter is a reference to a "secret"

	Only the qcow/qcow2 encryption format, and a "default" format used to
	let libvirt choose the format during volume creation, is currently
	supported.

	support lzop save compression for qemu
	Per prior discussion -- this was, indeed, trivial.

	I'm a little disappointed to be breaking the ordering characteristics of
	the enum (as it had been ordered by increasing time requirements and
	decreasing output size), but breaking any save files with the old
	constants in the headers would of course be worse.

	Date: Fri, 28 Aug 2009 11:49:54 -0500
	Subject: [PATCH] support lzop save compression for qemu

	One of the larger disincentives towards use of compression for migrated-out save
	files is performance impact. This patch adds support for lzop; CPU time for
	compression is about 5x faster than gzip (the next most performant algorithm)
	and decompression is about 3x faster.

	OpenVZ: accept NULL as type for GetMaxVCPUs.
	All of the other drivers that support the getMaxVcpus callback
	also accept a NULL value for type.  Make openvz also accept a
	NULL value.

	Remove use of strncpy in qemudExtractMonitorPath.
	qemudExtractMonitorPath() was doing a VIR_ALLOC_N followed by a
	strncpy.  However, this isn't necessary; we can do the same thing
	using strndup, which is much safer.

	Fix up virNodeGetCellsFreeMemory
	The documentation for virNodeGetCellsFreeMemory claims the values
	returned are in kilobytes, but that's actually wrong; the value
	returned is actually in bytes.  Fix up the documentation to be
	correct.

	Fix phypOpen() escape_specialcharacters
	Matthias correctly points out that escape_specialcharaters() takes a
	length, and since we are now malloc()'ing string in phypOpen instead of
	making it a static array, we can't use sizeof(string) anymore.  Calculate
	the proper strlen and then use that both to allocate the string and also
	pass it to escape_specialcharacters().

	Power Hypervisor: fix potential segfault
	I came across this line in the phypOpen function:

	char string[strlen(conn->uri->path)];

	Here the path part of the given URI is used without checking it for
	NULL, this can cause a segfault as strlen expects a string != NULL.
	Beside that uuid_db and connection_data leak in case of an error.

	In this line

	conn->uri->path = string;

	the original path of the URI leaks. The patch adds a VIR_FREE call
	before setting the new path.

	The attached patch is compile-tested but I don't have a Power
	Hypervisor installation at hand to test it for real.

	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/517371

	Matt Booth points out that if you use a non-existent bridge name when
	start a guest you get a weird error message:

	  Failed to add tap interface 'vnet%d' to bridge 'virbr0'

	and dev='vnet%d' appears in the dumpxml output.

	Fix that by not including 'vnet%d' in the error message and freeing the
	'vnet%d' string if adding the tap device to the bridge fails.

	* src/qemu_conf.c, src/uml_conf.c: fix qemudNetworkIfaceConnect()
	  and umlConnectTapDevice() to not expose 'vnet%d' to the user

	Maintain a list of active PCI hostdevs and use it in pciResetDevice()
	As we start/shutdown guests, or hotplug/hot-unplug devices, we can add
	or delete devices as appropriate from a list of active devices.

	Then, in pciReset(), we can use this to determine whether its safe to
	reset a device as a side effect of resetting another device.

	* src/qemu_conf.h: add activePciHostdevs to qemud_driver

	* src/qemu_driver.c: maintain the activePciHostdevs list, and pass it
	  to pciResetDevice()

	* src/pci.[ch]: pass the activeDevs list to pciResetDevice() and use
	  it to determine whether a Secondary Bus Reset is safe

	Simplify PCI hostdev prepare/re-attach using a pciDeviceList type
	The qemuPrepareHostDevices() and qemuDomainReAttachHostDevices()
	functions are clutter with a bunch of calls to pciGetDevice() and
	pciFreeDevice() obscuring the basic logic.

	Add a pciDeviceList type and add a qemuGetPciHostDeviceList() function
	to build a list from a domain definition. Use this in prepare/re-attach
	fto simplify things and eliminate the multiple pciGetDevice calls.

	This is especially useful because in the next patch we need to iterate
	the hostdevs list a third time and we also need a list type for keeping
	track of active devices.

	* src/pci.[ch]: add pciDeviceList type and also a per-device 'managed'
	  property

	* src/libvirt_private.syms: export the new functions

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add qemuGetPciHostDeviceList() and re-write
	  qemuPrepareHostDevices() and qemuDomainReAttachHostDevices() to use it

	Use pci_addr=auto with QEMU's pci_add monitor command
	Newer versions of QEMU accept 'pci_add auto', but older versions require
	'pci_add pci_addr=auto'

	* src/qemu_driver.c: use pci_addr= in qemudDomainAttachHostPciDevice()
	  for older versions of QEMU

	Fix thinko in PCI hostdev detach
	* src/qemu_driver.c: Add missing break statement in
	  qemudDomainDetachHostDevice()

	Reset PCI host devices after hot-unplug
	When we hot-unplug a PCI host device from a guest, we should reset it.

	Both managed and unmanaged devices should be reset, but only managed
	devices should be re-attached.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: reset devices in qemudDomainDetachHostPciDevice()

	Reset unmanaged PCI host devices before hotplug
	Right now we're only resetting managed devices before hotplug, but we
	should reset them irrespective of whether they are managed.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: reset all PCI hostdevs before hotplug

	Revert changes to allow pciResetDevice() reset multiple devices
	It turns out that the previous attempt at this doesn't work well
	in the case of hotplug. We need qemuCheckPciHostDevice() to
	disallow the reset affecting devices already attach to the guest,
	but we still need to avoid double locking the virDomainObjPtr.

	This is all getting messy, I've a better idea.

	This reverts commit 6318808270dd7679cd5dc082dcf2c7d85a432bd6 and
	c106c8a18c63d9e4f2547724a4a563706f8f6778.

	* src/qemu_driver.c, src/pci.[ch], src/xen_unified.c,
	  src/libvirt_private.syms: revert a bunch of stuff.

	Fix list updating after disk/network/hostdev hot-unplug
	The current code makes a poor effort at updating the device arrays after
	hot-unplug. Fix that and combine the two code paths into one.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: fix list updating in qemudDomainDetachNetDevice(),
	  qemudDomainDetachPciDiskDevice() and qemudDomainDetachHostPciDevice()

	Re-name remote_internal.c:driver to remote_driver
	Confused me when poking at another 'driver' variable in gdb which gcc
	had optimized away

	* src/remote_internal.c: rename driver to remote_driver

	Cosmetic change to 'virsh nodedev-list --tree' output
	Maybe it's just me, but I try to select an item from the tree using
	double-click and get annoyed when "+-" gets included in the selection.

	* src/virsh.c: add a space between "+-" and the node device name
	  in 'virsh nodedev-list --tree'

2009-08-18  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Fix up connection reference counting.
	Currently the reference counting for connections is busted.  I
	first noticed it while trying to use virConnectRef; it would
	eventually cause a crash in the remote_internal driver, although
	that was really just a victim.  Really, we should only call the
	close callbacks on the methods when the references drop to 0.  To
	accomplish this, move all of the close callbacks into
	virUnrefConnect (since there are lots of internal users of that
	function), and arrange for virConnectClose to call that.

	V2: Make sure to drop the connection lock before we call the close
	    callbacks, otherwise we could deadlock the daemon
	V3: Fix up a crash when we got an error from one of the drivers

2009-08-17  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Compressed save image format for Qemu.
	Implement a compressed save image format for qemu.  While ideally
	we would have the choice between compressed/non-compressed
	available to the libvirt API, unfortunately there is no "flags"
	parameter to the virDomainSave() API.  Therefore, implement this
	as a qemu.conf option.  gzip, bzip2, and lzma are implemented, and
	it should be very easy to implement additional compression
	methods.

	One open question is if/how we should detect the compression
	binaries.  One way to do it is to do compile-time setting of the
	paths (via configure.in), but that doesn't seem like a great thing
	to do.  My preferred solution is not to detect at all;
	when we go to run the commands that need them, if they
	aren't available, or aren't available in one of the standard paths,
	then we'll fail.  That's also the solution implemented in this patch.

	In the future, we'll have a more robust (managed) save/restore API,
	at which time we can expose this functionality properly in the API.

	V2: get rid of redundant dd command and just use >> to append data.
	V3: Add back the missing pieces for the enum and bumping the save version.
	V4: Make the compressed field in the save_header an int.
	    Implement LZMA compression.

	Remove 'the the' typo in docs

	Check active domain hostdevs before allowing PCI reset
	If a PCI device reset causes other devices to be reset, allow it so long
	as those other devices are note assigned to another active domain.

	Note, we need to take the driver lock qemudNodeDeviceReset() because the
	check function will iterate over the domain list.

	* src/qemu_conf.c: add qemuCheckPciHostDevice() to iterate over active
	  domains checking whether the affected device is assigned

	* src/pci.[ch]: add pciDeviceEquals() helper

	Allow pciResetDevice() to reset multiple devices
	When using a Secondary Bus Reset, all devices on the bus are reset.

	Extend the pciResetDevice() API so that a 'check' callback can be
	supplied which will verify that it is safe to reset the other devices
	on the bus.

	The virDomainObjPtr parameter is needed so that when the check function
	iterates over the domain list, it can avoid double locking.

	* src/pci.[ch]: add a 'check' callback to pciResetDevice(), re-work
	  pciIterDevices() to pass the check function to the iter functions,
	  use the check function in the bus iterator, return the first unsafe
	  device from pciBusCheckOtherDevices() and include its details in
	  the bus reset error message.

	* src/qemu_driver.c, src/xen_uninified.c: just pass NULL as the
	  check function for now

	Improve PCI host device reset error message
	Currently, if we are unable to reset a PCI device we return a fairly
	generic 'No PCI reset capability available' error message.

	Fix that by returning an error from the individual reset messages and
	using that error to construct the higher level error mesage.

	* src/pci.c: set errors in pciTryPowerManagementReset() and
	  pciTrySecondaryBusReset() on failure; use those error messages
	  in pciResetDevice(), or explain that no reset support is available

	Reset and re-attach PCI host devices on guest shutdown
	When the guest shuts down, we should attempt to restore all PCI host
	devices to a sane state.

	In the case of managed hostdevs, we should reset and re-attach the
	devices. In the case of unmanaged hostdevs, we should just reset them.

	Note, KVM will already reset assigned devices when the guest shuts
	down using whatever means it can, so we are only doing it to cover the
	cases the kernel can't handle.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add qemuDomainReAttachHostDevices() and call
	  it from qemudShutdownVMDaemon()

	Allow PM reset on multi-function PCI devices
	It turns out that a PCI Power Management reset only affects individual
	functions, and not the whole device.

	The PCI Power Management spec talks about resetting the 'device' rather
	than the 'function', but Intel's Dexuan Cui informs me that it is
	actually a per-function reset.

	Also, Yu Zhao has added pci_pm_reset() to the kernel, and it doesn't
	reject multi-function devices, so it must be true! :-)

	(A side issue is that we could defer the PM reset to the kernel if we
	could detect that the kernel has PM reset support, but barring version
	number checks we don't have a way to detect that support)

	* src/pci.c: remove the pciDeviceContainsOtherFunctions() check from
	  pciTryPowerManagementReset() and prefer PM reset over bus reset
	  where both are available

	Cc: Cui, Dexuan <dexuan.cui@intel.com>
	Cc: Yu Zhao <yu.zhao@intel.com>

	Detect KVM's PCI device assignment support
	PCI device assignment is only supported in KVM's fork of qemu, so we
	should really detect its availability and give a nice error if its
	not supported.

	* src/qemu_conf.[ch]: introduce QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_PCIDEVICE indicating
	  that the -pcidevice command line option is available

	* tests/*: update the tests

	Add host PCI device hotplug support
	Attaching a host PCI device to a qemu guest is done with a
	straightforward 'pci_add auto host host=XX:XX.X' command.

	Like with NIC and disk hotplug, we need to retain the guest PCI address
	assigned by qemu so that we can use it for hot-unplug.

	Identifying a device for detach is done using the host PCI address.

	Managed mode is handled by detaching/resetting the device before
	attaching it to the guest and re-attaching it after detaching it from
	the guest.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add qemudDomainAttachHostPciDevice() and
	  qemudDomainDetachHostPciDevice()

	* src/domain_conf.h: add somewhere to store the guest PCI address

	* src/domain_conf.c: handle formatting and parsing the guest PCI
	  address

	Re-factor hostdev hotplug
	Re-factor the hostdev hotplug code so that we can easily add PCI
	hostdev hotplug to qemudDomainAttachHostDevice().

	* src/qemu_driver.c: rename qemudDomainAttachHostDevice() to
	  qemudDomainAttachHostUsbDevice(); make qemudDomainAttachHostDevice()
	  handle all hostdev types

	* src/libvirt_private.syms: export a couple of hostdev related
	  ToString() functions

	Make LXC / UML drivers robust against NUMA topology brokenness
	Some kernel versions expose broken NUMA topology for some machines.
	This causes the LXC/UML drivers to fail to start. QEMU driver was
	already fixed for this problem

	* src/lxc_conf.c: Log and ignore failure to populate NUMA info
	* src/uml_conf.c: Log and ignore failure to populate NUMA info

	Remove a duplicated assignment in Xen PCI parsing.

	Fix up a few minor indentation issues.

	Fix phyp escape_specialcharacters.
	A couple of minor fixes to phyp escape_specialcharacters.  Make it
	a static function (since it's only used in phyp/phyp_driver.c), and
	make it take a dstlen parameter.  This paves the way for removing
	strncpy in the future.

	Make openvzGetVPSUUID take a len.
	Minor fix to openvzGetVPSUUID to make it take a length parameter.
	This ensures that it doesn't make assumptions about the length
	of the UUID buffer, and paves the way for removal of strncpy in
	the future.

	Minor cleanup of error path for c_oneVmInfo.

	Fix up a whitespace in comments in src/console.c

	Fix up a stray whitespace in virHashGrow.

	Run 'cont' on successful migration finish.
	As of qemu 0.10.6, qemu now honors the -S flag on incoming migration.
	That means that when the migration completes, we have to issue a
	'cont' command to get the VM running again.  We do it unconditionally
	since it won't hurt on older qemu.

	Split virDomainMigrate into functions.
	Re-factor virDomainMigrate to split out the version 1 and version 2
	protocols into their own functions.  In reality, the two versions share
	very little in common, so forcing them together in the same function was
	just confusing.  This will also make adding tunnelled migration easier.

	Fix QEMU domain status after restore.
	When doing a restore, we were forgetting to update the state file
	for the VM.  That means that if you do a save/restore, then shut
	down libvirtd, then start it back up, you'll see the state of the
	guest as "paused", even though it is really running.  We were
	just forgetting a "virDomainSaveStatus" call in the restor path.

	  libvir: Network Config error :
	  cannot enable /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/virbr0/disable_ipv6:
	  No such file or directory

	If disable_ipv6 is not present, we should just merrily continue on our

	* src/network_driver.c: make networkDisableIPV6() not fail if the kernel
	  has no ipv6 support

	Set perms on /var/lib/libvirt/boot to 0711

	chown kernel/initrd before spawning qemu
	If we're running qemu unprivileged, we need to chown any supplied kernel
	or initrd before spawning it.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: rename qemuDomainSetDiskOwnership() to
	  qemuDomainSetFileOwnership(), pass it a path string instead of a disk
	  definition and use it for chowning the kernel/initrd in

	  convert high priority levels to debug level. Ignore LIBVIRT_LOG_FILTERS
	  and LIBVIRT_LOG_OUTPUTS when they're set to the empty string, otherwise
	  they can override a valid setting from the config file. Send all
	  settings through the parser functions for validation, so that the
	  existence of a bad setting doesn't nullify a good setting that should
	  have applied -- particularly the default output. Keep the order of
	  precedence consistent for all variables between the environment and
	  the config file.  Warn when an invalid log level, filter, or output
	  is ignored.
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: export internally a few convenience functions

	Tighten libvirt's parsing of logging env

2009-07-27  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Add support for attaching network/bridge NICs in QEMU driver
	In order to hotplug a network/bridge backed NIC, we need to first create
	the tap file descriptor, add the tap interface to the bridge and then
	pass the file descriptor to the qemu process using the 'getfd' monitor
	command.

	Once the tapfd has been accepted, we create the network backend using
	host_net_add, supplying the name assigned to the tapfd. If this fails,
	we need to close the tapfd in qemu using the 'closefd' monitor command.

	If the version of qemu does not support the getfd/closefd monitor
	commands we detect "unknown command" in the getfd reply and fail the
	attach operation.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add support for tapfd based hotplug in
	  qemudDomainAttachNetDevice()

	Add SCM_RIGHTS support to QEMU monitor code
	Add qemudMonitorCommandWithFd() which allows a file descriptor to be
	sent to qemu over a unix monitor socket using SCM_RIGHTS. See the
	unix(7) and cmsg(3) man pages.

	* src/qemu_conf.c: add a scm_fd param to qemudMonitorCommandExtra(),
	  add qemudMonitorCommandWithFd(), implement SCM_RIGHTS support in
	  qemudMonitorSendUnix()

	Use sendmsg() on QEMU monitor socket
	Switch from using write() to using sendmsg() on QEMU's monitor socket
	so that we can add support for SCM_RIGHTS.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add sendmsg() based qemudMonitorSendUnix() and use
	  it when the monitor fd is a unix socket

	Factor qemudMonitorSend() out of qemudMonitorCommandExtra()
	Add a little helper function to write the monitor command followed by
	carriage return in a single write.

	This doesn't make any real difference, but allows us to more easily
	switch to using sendmsg() when using the monitor over a unix socket.

	* src/qemu_conf.c: split qemudMonitorSend() out

	Clean up error handling in qemudDomainAttachNetDevice()
	In subsequent patches we're going to have a file descriptor to close
	too, so centralize the error handling cleanups to make things easier.

	* src/qemu_conf.c: in qemudDomainAttachNetDevice() consolidate the
	  error handling cleanups together

	Make qemuBuildHostNetStr() take tapfd as a string
	With hotplug, we're going to want to pass a tapfd name rather than an
	actual file descriptor, so prepare the way by passing a string tapfd to
	qemuBuildHostNetStr().

	* src/qemu_conf.h: qemuBuildHostNetStr() takes a string tapfd now

	* src/qemu_conf.c: pass qemuBuildHostNetStr() a string rather than an
	  actual file descriptor

	* src/qemu_driver.c: update qemudDomainAttachNetDevice() for change

	Move vnet_hdr logic into qemudNetworkIfaceConnect() and export it
	* src/qemu_conf.h: export qemudNetworkIfaceConnect()

	* src/qemu_conf.c: move vnet_hdr logic into qemudNetworkIfaceConnect()
	  since we need it for hotplug too

	Only probe qemu for machine types when binary changes
	By probing for qemu machine types, we increased the time of a
	GetCapabilities call from 100us to a whopping 60ms.

	This patch takes the approach of only probing for machine types
	when the mtime of the emulator binary changed since the last time
	the capabilities were generated.

	* src/capabilities.h: cache the emulator binary mtime

	* src/qemu_conf.c: add qemudGetOldMachines() to copy the machine
	  types from the old caps struct if the mtime for the binary hasn't
	  changed

	* src/qemu_conf.h, src/qemu_driver.c: pass the old caps pointer to
	  qemudCapsInit()

	Add canonical machine name to capabilities output
	e.g. <machine canonical='pc'>pc-0.11</machine>

	* src/capabilities.c: output the canonical machine names in the
	  capabilities output, if available

	* docs/schemas/capabilities.rng: add the new attribute

	Probe QEMU directly for machine aliases if not found in capabilties
	Not all possible emulators are actually in the capabilities, so if we
	don't find the supplied emulator we should probe it directly for machine
	types.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add qemudCanonicalizeMachineDirect() to directly
	  probe an emulator for the canonical machine type

	Canonicalize qemu machine types
	In qemu-0.11 there is a 'pc-0.10' machine type which allows you to run
	guests with a machine which is compatible with the pc machine in
	qemu-0.10 - e.g. using the original PCI class for virtio-blk and
	virtio-console and disabling MSI support in virtio-net. The idea here
	is that we don't want to suprise guests by changing the hardware when
	qemu is updated.

	I've just posted some patches for qemu-0.11 which allows libvirt to
	canonicalize the 'pc' machine alias to the latest machine version.

	This patches makes us use that so that when a guest is configured to
	use the 'pc' machine type, we resolve that to 'pc-0.11' machine and
	save that in the guest XML.

	See also:

	  https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/KVM_Stable_Guest_ABI

	* src/qemu_conf.c: add qemudCanonicalizeMachine() to canonicalize
	  the machine type according to the machine aliases in capabilities

	* src/qemu_driver.c: parse aliases in qemudParseMachineTypesStr()

	Add virCapsGuestMachine structure
	A subsequent commit will add a "canonical" field to this structure,
	this patch basically just prepares the way for that.

	The new type is added, along with virCapabilitiesAlloc/FreeMachines()
	helpers and a whole bunch of code to make the transition.

	One quirk is that virCapabilitiesAddGuestDomain() and
	virCapabilitiesAddGuest() take ownership of the machine list rather
	than duping it. This makes sense to avoid needless copying.

	* src/capabilities.h: add the virCapsGuestMachine struct and use it
	  in virCapsGuestDomainInfo, add prototypes for new functions and
	  update the AddGuest() prototypes

	* src/capabilities.c: add code for allocating and freeing the new
	  type, change the machines parameter to AddGuest() etc.

	* src/libvirt_private.syms: export the new helpers

	* src/qemu_conf.c: update all the machine type code to use the new
	  struct

	* src/xen_internal.c: ditto

	* tests/testutilsqemu.c: ditto

	Probe for QEMU machine types
	Currently we hardcode the QEMU machine types. We should really just
	parse the output of 'qemu -M ?' so the lists don't get out of sync.

	xenner doesn't support '-M ?', so we still need to hardcode that.

	The horrible (const char *const *) is removed in a subsequent patch.

	* src/qemu_conf.c: kill the arch_info*machines tables, retain the
	  hardcoded xenner machine type, add qemudProbeMachineTypes() to
	  run and parse 'qemu -M ?' and use it in qemudCapsInitGuest()

	Cleanup qemu binary detection logic in qemudCapsInitGuest()
	There's no need for the hasbase/hasaltbase confusion, just store the
	first binary path found in a variable.

	* src/qemu_conf.c: kill hasbase/hasaltbase logic in qemudCapsInitGuest()

	Don't allow NULL paths for BlockStats and InterfaceStats
	Do the check in libvirt.c, to save drivers from the burden. This changes
	behavior slightly in the qemu driver: we no longer explictly error if
	passed an empty string. An error will still be thrown when the device
	lookup fails.

	python: Raise exceptions if virDomain*Stats fail.
	The generator couldn't tell that the stats return values were pointers.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: use qemudParsePciAddReply() to pull the PCI
	  address from the pci_add reply

	* src/domain_conf.c: handle storing and parsing the PCI address in the
	  domain state XML file

	Re-factor pci_add reply parsing and parse domain/bus numbers
	The current code for parsing pci_add replies ignores the the domain and
	bus numbers. Re-write the code to rectify that.

	Also, since pci_add is used for NIC hotplug as well ask disk hotplug,
	re-factor the code into a separate function.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add qemudParsePciAddReply() function which can
	  handle parsing domain and bus numbers

	Remove the network backend if NIC hotplug fails
	If we fail to pci_add a NIC, we should remove the network backend and
	leave things the way we found them. To do that, we pre-allocate a
	host_net_remove monitor command and issue that if the pci_add fails.
	If the remove fails, we just log a warning.

	We can only do this if we have a name for the network backend and
	we know the vlan number its associated with.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: host_net_remove the network backend if the
	  pci_add fails

	Basic qemu NIC hotplug support
	Implement basic NIC hotplug support using the 'host_net_add' and
	'pci_add' qemu monitor commands.

	For now, we don't support 'bridge' or 'network' types.

	Also, if pci_add fails, we currently fail to remove the backend
	which we added.

	Finally, NIC hot-unplug support is missing.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add qemudDomainAttachNetDevice()

	* src/qemu_conf.[ch]: export qemuBuildNicStr(), qemuBuildHostNetStr()
	  and qemuAssignNames()

	* src/libvirt_private.syms: export virDomainNetTypeToString()

	Make qemuCmdFlags available in qemudDomainAttachDevice()
	qemudDomainChangeEjectableMedia() currently extracts the qemu command
	line flags, but other device attaching code might need it, so move
	the qemudExtractVersionInfo() call up a frame.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: move the qemudExtractVersionInfo() call from
	  qemudDomainChangeEjectableMedia() to qemudDomainAttachDevice()

	Store the interface vlan number in the domain state
	Currently, an interface's vlan number corresponds to its index in
	the table of network interfaces. That is no longer true when we
	allow devices to be removed.

	To fix this, we store the vlan number in the domain's state XML
	so that it survives libvirtd restarts.

	* src/domain_conf.h: add vlan number to virDomainNetDef

	* src/domain_conf.c: store it in XML as <state vlan='N'/>, defaulting
	  to -1 if this is state saved by a previous version of libvirt

	* src/qemu_conf.c: assign vlan numbers before starting qemu

	Add NIC and hostnet names to domain state XML
	The qemu driver needs to assign and keep track of identifiers for
	network devices so that it can remove them. We need to keep this state
	across libvirtd restarts, but it's not configuration that needs to
	be kept across guest restarts.

	* src/domain_conf.c: parse and format <state nic="foo" hostnet="bar"/>

	Assign names to qemu NICs and network backends
	We need these so that we can remove the devices via the monitor.

	* src/domain_conf.h: add nic_name and hostnet_name to virDomainNetDef

	* src/domain_conf.c: free nic_name and hostnet_name

	* src/qemu_conf.c: add qemuAssignNetNames(), use it if qemu has
	  support for the param and pass the names on the command line

	* tests/qemuxml2argv*: add a test for this

	Add checks for some NIC hotplug related features added in qemu-0.10.0
	Add QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_NET_NAME to indicate that '-net ...,name=foo' is
	supported and QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_HOST_NET_ADD to indicate that the
	'host_net_add' monitor command is available.

	Set both these flags if the qemu version is greater than 0.10.0.
	Checking via the '-help' output would not work for the monitor command
	and even for the command line arg, it would be quite fragile.

	* src/qemu_conf.h: add new flags as aliases of QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_0_10

	* src/qemu_conf.c: set QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_0_10 for versions >= 0.10.0

	* tests/qemuhelptest.c: set QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_0_10 for the appropriate
	  qemu versions

	Factor qemuBuildHostNetStr() out from qemuBuildCommandLine()
	Re-factor this code so that it can be used for NIC hotplug
	too. The awkward prefix and type_sep arguments are needed to
	allow us to do "host_net_add tap vlan=..."

	* src/qemu_conf.c: factor the net backend string formatting
	  code into its own function

	Factor qemuBuildNicStr() out from qemuBuildCommandLine()
	Re-factor this code so that it can be used for NIC hotplug
	too. The awkward arguments are needed to allow use to do
	"pci_add auto nic macaddr=..."

	* src/qemu_conf.c: factor the nic string formatting code into
	  its own function

	Retain disk PCI address across libvirtd restarts
	When we hot-plug a disk device into a qemu guest, we need to retain its
	PCI address so that it can be removed again later. Currently, we do
	retain the slot number, but not across libvirtd restarts.

	Add <state devaddr="xxxx:xx:xx"/> to the disk device XML config when the
	VIR_DOMAIN_XML_INTERNAL_STATUS flag is used. We still don't parse the
	domain and bus number, but the format allows us to do that in future.

	* src/domain_conf.h: replace slotnum with pci_addr struct, add helper
	  for testing whether the address is valid

	* src/domain_conf.c: handle formatting and parsing the address

	* src/qemu_driver.c: store the parsed slot number as a full PCI address,
	  and use this address with the pci_del monitor command

	* src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c: we're debug printing slotnum here even though
	  it can never be set, just delete it

	Add internal XML parsing/formatting flag
	We need to store things like device names and PCI slot numbers in the
	qemu domain state file so that we don't lose that information on
	libvirtd restart. Add a flag to indicate that this information should
	be parsed or formatted.

	Make bit 16 and above of the flags bitmask for internal use only and
	consume the first bit for this new status flag.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h: add VIR_DOMAIN_XML_FLAGS_MASK

	* src/libvirt.c: reject private flags in virDomainGetXMLDesc()

	* src/domain_conf.h: add VIR_DOMAIN_XML_INTERNAL_STATUS

	* src/domain_conf.c: pass the flag from virDomainObjParseXML() and
	  virDomainSaveStatus

2009-07-21  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Add interface object list manipulation functions
	* interface_conf.c interface_conf.h: utilities function usful for

	virGetinterface matching of MAC and interface name
	MAC address of a particular interface may change over time, and the
	reduced virInterface object (which contains just name and mac) needs
	to reflect these changes. Since we can't modify the mac address of an
	existing virInterface (some other thread may currently be using it) we
	just create a new virInterface, and let the old one die a dignified
	death when its refct goes to 0.
	* src/datatypes.c: fix the matching and lifetime of virInterface object
	  accordingly

	Add an error code for conflicting mac addresses
	* include/libvirt/virterror.h src/virterror.c: if a driver's
	  virInterfaceLookupByMACString() function finds more than one interface
	  with the desired MAC Address, this new error is raised.

2009-07-17  Cole Robinson  <crobinso@redhat.com>

	Fix gitweb link on download page.

	qemu: Try multiple times to open unix monitor socket
	Unlike the pty monitor (which we know exists since we scrape its path from
	stdout), we have no way of knowing that the unix monitor socket should exist/
	be initialized. As a result, some of my KVM guests randomly fail to start on
	F10 host.

	Try to open the unix socket in a 3 second timeout loop. Ignore EACCES (path
	does not exist if a first time run) and ECONNREFUSED (leftover socket from
	a previous run hasn't been removed yet). Fixes things for me.

	storage: Implement CreateVolFrom for logical and disk backend.
	With the previous refactoring, this is a simple process, since the global
	'CreateBlockFrom' in storage_backend does all the work.

	storage: Don't try sparse detection if writing to block device.
	We don't gain any space savings, so skip the detection to speed up
	the cloning operation.

	storage: Implement 'CreateBlockFrom' helper.
	Add a 'CreateBlockFrom' in the global storage_backend, which sets up the
	destination block device: CopyFromFD does the rest of the cloning.

	storage: Break out actual raw cloning to separate function.
	The CreateRaw function has some 'file' only assumptions, so break the agnostic
	cloning bits to a separate function.

	storage: cleanup: do away with 'createFile'
	Have storage building functions be definitions of
	virStorageBackendBuildVolFrom: we will need to do this in the future anyways
	if we ever support the flags attribute.

	storage: Move most of the FS creation functions to common backend.
	These will be used by other pool cloning implementations.

	storage: Refactor FS backend 'create' function choosing.
	Break out separate functions for

	- Determining the supported '*-img' tool,
	- The tool's associated create function,
	- Desired function for cloning (CreateXMLFrom).

	This will be eventually used to unify cloning across all backends.

	storage: Fix deadlock when cloning across pools.
	We need to unlock the first pool before looking up the second, since the
	search locks every pool it checks.

	storage: disk: Use capacity, not allocation, when creating volume.
	There isn't any way to dictate allocation when creating disk volumes, so
	capacity is the only relevant value.

	storage: disk: Default to 'ext2' for new volumes.
	Currently, if no format is specified for a new disk volume, we pass the
	invalid value "none" as the FS type to 'parted mkpart'.

	There doesn't seem to be a way to have parted not format the drive, so
	just default to using 'ext2' in this case: this shouldn't cause any harm,
	since we are creating a new partition in the first place.

	storage: disk: Fix segfault creating volume without target path
	Remove unneeded target path duplication, which could carelessly dereference
	NULL. Make it clear where 'key' is actually filled in.

	storage: disk: Fix parthelper '-g' option handling.
	Typo was breaking 'parthelper -g', preventing disk pool definition.

2009-07-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Rename a bunch of internal methods to clarify their meaning
	This renames a lot of the methods in the remote driver client
	to more accurately reflect their responsibility of IO handling
	vs message handling.

	Simplify remote driver error reporting
	Remove redundant error reporting functions which obscured the
	filename/line number reporting. Removed code which created a
	virDomain/virNetwork object, since those are silently dropped
	in error reporting functions now

	* src/remote_internal.c: Remove error() and errorf() in favour of
	 macros, and remove server_error in favour of direct call

	Refactor message sending to allow code reuse for data streams
	Splits up the 'call' method moving generic IO code out into
	separate method to allow it to be easily reused for sending
	data streams

	* src/remote_internal.c: Split 'call' into two methods, the first
	  with same name serializes a set of method arguments into a
	  message, the second 'remoteIO' takes a pre-serialized messages,
	  sends it and awaits a reply

	Refactor incoming message handling to prepare for data stream support
	* src/remote_internal.c: Rename processCallRecvMsg to
	  processCallDispatch, and move code specific to method replies
	  into processCallDispatchReply, and rename processCallAsyncEvent
	  to processCallDispatchMessage

	Rename 'direction' to 'type' in remote_message_header
	The 'remote_message_header' struct has a mis-leadingly named
	field 'direction'. It is really a reflection of the type of
	message, and some types can be sent in either direction. Thus
	the field is more accurately named 'type'. No function change.

	* qemud/remote_protocol.x: Rename 'direction' to 'type' in
	  'remote_message_header. Write better docs describing the
	  message header field semantics & usage
	* qemud/remote_protocol.c, qemud/remote_protocol.h: Regenerate
	* qemud/remote.c, qemud/dispatch.c, src/remote_internal.c
	  Update to reflect rename of 'direction' to 'type'

	Define an API for registering incoming message dispatch filters
	All incoming messages currently get routed to the generic method
	remoteDispatchClientRequest() for processing. To allow incoming
	data stream messages to bypass this and be routed to a specific
	location, a concept of dispatch filters is introduced.

	* qemud/qemud.h: Add a qemud_client_filter struct and a callback
	  qemud_client_filter_func. Maintain a list of filters on every
	  struct qemud_client
	* qemud/qemud.c: Move remoteDecodeClientMessageHeader() out of
	  qemudWorker() into qemudDispatchClientRead(). Check registered
	  message filters in qemudDispatchClientRead() to decide where
	  to send incoming messages for dispatch.

	Split out code for handling incoming method call messages
	The remoteDispatchClientRequest() method is currently hardwired to
	assume there is only one type of incoming message, a method call.
	To allow for alternate types of incoming messags, the code that is
	specific to method calls is being split into a separate method
	remoteDispatchClientCall

	* qemud/dispatch.c: Move method call specific code out into
	  remoteDispatchClientCall. Add a helper remoteSerializeError
	  for returning error messages to client

	Change the way client event loop watches are managed
	The current qemudRegisterClientEvent() code is used both for
	registering the initial socket watch, and updating the already
	registered watch. This causes unneccessary complexity in alot
	of code which only cares about updating existing watches. The
	updating of a watch cannot ever fail, nor is a reference to the
	'qemud_server' object required.

	This introduces a new qemudUpdateClientEvent() method for that
	case, allowing the elimination of unneccessary error checking
	and removal of the server back-reference in struct qemud_client.

	* qemud/qemud.h: Remove 'server' field from struct qemud_client.
	  Add qemudUpdateClientEvent() method. Remove 'update' param
	  from qemudRegisterClientEvent method
	* qemud/dispatch.c, qemud/qemud.c, qemud/remote.c: Update alot
	  of code to use qemudUpdateClientEvent() instead of
	  qemudRegisterClientEvent(). Move more logic from remoteRelayDomainEvent
	  into remoteDispatchDomainEventSend.

	Move queuing of RPC replies into dispatch code
	This removes an assumption from qemudWorker() code that every
	incoming message will generate a reply.

	* qemud/dispatch.c: remoteDispatchClientRequest now has responsibility
	  for queuing the reply message to the RPC call
	* qemud/qemud.c: Do not queue the RPC call reply in qemudWorker(),
	  allowing remoteDispatchClientRequest() to take care of it

	Change code generator to give async event messages their own postfix
	The naming convention for structs used in the RPC layer is for
	incoming requests to be called XXXX_args, and the associated
	outgoing reply to be called XXXX_ret.  Asynchronously emitted
	messages (eg events) are re-using the XXXX_ret naming scheme.
	This patch changes that such that async messages are XXXX_msg,
	and stops adding entries for them in the dispatch table, avoiding
	the need for a dummy no-op implementation.

	* qemud/remote.c: Remove dummy remoteDispatchDomainEvent, no
	  longer required. Update to replace remote_domain_event_ret
	  with xdr_remote_domain_event_msg
	* qemud/remote_protocol.x: Rename remote_domain_event_ret to
	  remote_domain_event_msg
	* qemud/remote_generate_stubs.pl: Adding handling for new
	  XXX_msg structs.
	* src/remote_internal.c: Rename remote_domain_event_ret to
	  remote_domain_event_msg
	* qemud/remote_dispatch_prototypes.h, qemud/remote_dispatch_ret.h,
	  qemud/remote_dispatch_table.h, qemud/remote_protocol.h,
	  qemud/remote_protocol.c: auto-regenerate

	Separate code for encoding outgoing remote message headers
	Introduces an API for encoding the header field for outgoing messages
	allowing some duplicated code to be eliminated

	* qemud/dispatch.c, qemud/dispatch.h: add remoteEncodeClientMessageHeader
	  for encoding message header. Update remoteDispatchClientRequest to
	  use this method.
	* qemud/remote.c: Update remoteDispatchDomainEventSend to use the
	  generic remoteEncodeClientMessageHeader() for encoding event
	  message hedaders. Push some logic from remoteRelayDomainEvent
	  down into remoteDispatchDomainEventSend.

	Decode incoming request header before invoking dispatch code
	Separate the decoding of incoming request header out from the
	dispatch code. This will allow later code to making dispatcher
	routing decisions based on the header field data.

	* qemud/dispatch.c, qemud/dispatch.h: Add remoteDecodeClientMessageHeader
	  API for decoding the header of a client message. Update the
	  remoteDispatchClientRequest method to assume a pre-decoded
	  header.
	* qemud/qemud.h: Include a 'remote_message_header' field in
	  'struct qemud_client_message' for pre-decoded header data
	* qemud/qemud.c: Decode the incoming client message header before
	  invoking remoteDispatchClientRequest

	Split generic RPC message dispatch code out from remote protocol API handlers
	* po/POTFILES.in: Add qemud/dispatch.c
	* qemud/dispatch.c, qemud/dispatch.h: Generic code handling dispatch of
	  RPC messages.
	* qemud/Makefile.am: Add dispatch.c to build
	* qemud/qemud.c: Include dispatch.h
	* qemud/qemud.h: Remove remoteDispatchClientRequest, remoteRelayDomainEvent
	  now in dispatch.h
	* qemud/remote.c: Remove remoteDispatchClientRequest, remoteRelayDomainEvent
	  now in dispatch.c, and dispatch_args, dispatch_ret, dispatch_fn & dispatch_data
	  now in remote.h
	* qemud/remote.h: Add typedefs for dispatch_args, dispatch_ret,
	  dispatch_fn, dispath_data. Add remoteGetDispatchData() API

	* tests/interfaceschemadata/*.xml: set of test files from netcf-0.1.0
	  changed to use single quote instead of double quote

	add support for netcf XML import and export
	* src/interface_conf.c src/interface_conf.h: the import and export
	  routines and the internal APIs
	* src/Makefile.am: hook the new file in the makefiles
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: export a few private symbols internally
	* po/POTFILES.in: the new file contains translatable strings

2009-07-15  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Ensure test:/// URIs get routed to the non-privileged libvirtd
	* src/remote_internal.c: Ensure that all test:/// URIs are dealt
	  with by the auto-started, per-user unprivileged libvirtd instances

	Fix error reporting for security driver over remote protocol
	* qemud/remote.c: Send back the actual libvirt connection error
	  rather than formatting a generic error for security driver
	  methods
	* src/libvirt.c: Fix virDomainGetSecurityLabel, and
	  virNodeGetSecurityModel to correctly set the error on
	  the virConnectPtr object, and raise a full error rather
	  than warning when not supported

2009-07-15  Garry Dolley  <gdolley@arpnetworks.com>

	Update the links for RHEL libvirt bugzillas

2009-07-13  Garry Dolley  <gdolley@ucla.edu>

	Update links to bugzilla
	* docs/bugs.html[.in]: general tickets are under the 'Virtualization
	  Tools' product category and Fedora specific tickets are under the
	  'Fedora' product category.

2009-07-11  Cole Robinson  <crobinso@redhat.com>

	Fix docs and code disagreements for character devices.
	The 'pipe' character type wasn't documented.
	TCP uses a <protocol> element, not <wire>
	We weren't doing strict validation for protocol and source mode values.

	qemu: Check driver is initialized up front, to avoid segfault.
	If the qemu_driver was not initialized (possibly due to an error on driver
	startup), we can segfault if attempting to connect to the URI.

2009-07-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: automatically rerun ./bootstrap when needed
	When "git pull" (or any other operation) brings in a new version of the
	gnulib git submodule, you must rerun the autogen.sh script.  With this
	change, "make" now fails and tells you to run ./autogen.sh, when needed.
	* autogen.sh: Maintain a new file, .git-module-status, containing
	the current submodule status.  If it doesn't exist or its content
	is different from what "git submodule status" prints, then run
	./bootstrap
	* .gitignore: Add .git-module-status
	* cfg.mk: Diagnose out of date submodule and fail.
	* README-hacking: Update not to mention bootstrap.
	* Makefile.am (MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Add .git-module-status,
	so that "make maintainerclean" will remove it.

	build: make autogen.sh use autoreconf -if
	* autogen.sh: Use "autoreconf -if" instead of open-coding it with
	manual and unconditional invocation of each separate tool.

2009-07-10  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Use virDomainChrTypeFromString() instead of open coding
	* src/domain_conf.c: replace open coded chr type parsing with
	  virDomainChrTypeFromString(), retaining the existing semantics
	  where unknown types are silently mapped to the "null" type and
	  "pty" is used if none is specified

	Switch to using a unix socket for the qemu monitor
	We keep support for the pty based monitor so that we can re-connect
	to VMs started by older versions of libvirtd.

	* src/domain_conf.c: handle formatting and parsing unix monitors

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add qemudOpenMonitorUnix(), remove the monitor
	  pty path searching from qemudFindCharDevicePTYs(), switch
	  qemudStartVMDaemon() and qemuDomainXMLToNative() to using a unix
	  monitor

	* tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c: switch to using a unix monitor

	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-*.args: update test data

	Add the monitor type to the domain state XML
	There are no functional changes in this patch apart from adding the
	monitor type to the state XML.

	The patch mostly consists of switching to use virDomainChrDef every
	where to describe the monitor.

	* src/domain_conf.h: replace monitorpath with monitor_chr

	* src/domain_conf.c: handle parsing the monitor type and initializing
	  monitor chr

	* src/qemu_conf.[ch]: make qemudBuildCommandLine take a
	  virDomainChrDefPtr and use that to build the -monitor parameter

	* src/qemu_driver.c: split pty specific and common code from
	  qemudOpenMonitor, have qemudStartVMDaemon() initialize monitor_chr

	* tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c: update for qemudBuildCommandLine() change

	Minor qemu monitor coding style fixes
	* src/qemu_driver.c: use a consistent coding style for function
	  definitions

	Don't leak vm->monitorpath on re-connect
	* src/qemu_driver.c: vm->monitorpath is already initialized in the case
	  of re-connect, so move the initialization for the normal startup case
	  out of the common code

2009-07-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: update from gnulib, for latest maint.mk
	* gnulib: Update submodule to latest.
	This fixes the make syntax-check failure whereby sc_po_check
	would complain about cfg.mk.

	avoid a "make syntax-check" failure
	* .x-sc_avoid_if_before_free: Ignore *all* ChangeLog files,
	now, including ChangeLog-old.

2009-07-09  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix wierd build problems due to autopoint overwriting gnulib m4
	* Makefile.am: List -I m4 first, in ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS
	* .gitignore: ignore gnulib/, ChangeLog, *rej, *orig, *#*# (emacs
	  temporary files)

2009-07-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	doc: clone+build instructions
	* README-hacking: New file.
	* bootstrap: Remove obsolete comments.

	build: adjust aclocal's search patch to prefer gnulib's m4 files.
	* Makefile.am (ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): Search gnulib/m4/ before m4/.

2009-07-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	generate ChangeLog from git logs into distribution tarball
	No longer maintain a version-controlled ChangeLog file, but do
	continue to include a ChangeLog file in distribution tarball.
	* Makefile.am (gen-ChangeLog): New rule.
	(dist-hook): Depend on it.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add ChangeLog-old.
	* bootstrap (modules): Add gitlog-to-changelog.
	* ChangeLog: Remove file.  Renamed to...
	* ChangeLog-old: ...this.  New file.
	* autogen.sh: Touch ChangeLog, to ensure it exists.  For automake.

	use gnumakefile and maintainer-makefile modules from gnulib
	* bootstrap (modules): Add gnumakefile and maintainer-makefile.
	* GNUmakefile: Remove file, now provided by gnulib.
	* Makefile.maint: Remove.  Replaced by maint.mk from gnulib.
	.gitignore: Add GNUmakefile and maint.mk.
	* cfg.mk (prev_version_file): Disable this feature.
	Setting this to /dev/null avoids an otherwise harmless diagnostic.

	remove all .cvsignore files

	make .gnulib a submodule
	This makes it so we record (via a git submodule)
	a snapshot of whatever version of gnulib we're using,
	and none of gnulib sources are in the libvirt repository.
	The result is that we have as much reproducibility as when
	we version-controlled imported copies of the gnulib sources,
	but without the hassle of the manual process we used when
	syncing with upstream.

	Note that when you clone libvirt, you get only the libvirt
	repository, but when you first run ./bootstrap, it clones
	gnulib (at the SHA1 recorded via the submodule), creating
	the .gnulib/ hierarchy.  Then, the bootstrap script runs
	gnulib-tool to populate gnulib/ with the files that make
	up the selected modules.

	Put the following in your ~/.gitconfig file.
	[alias]
	  syncsub = submodule foreach git pull origin master

	The update procedure is simple:
	  git syncsub
	  ...build & test...
	  git commit -m 'gnulib: sync submodule to latest' .gnulib

	* .gitmodules: New file.
	* .gnulib: Initialize.
	* bootstrap: Set up to use the new submodule.
	Stop using --no-vc-files.
	Don't remove .gitignore files.
	Don't use or create .cvsignore.
	Diagnose an invalid --gnulib-srcdir=DIR argument.
	* build-aux/vc-list-files: Delete file, now pulled from gnulib.
	* build-aux/useless-if-before-free: Likewise.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Remove gnulib/lib/gai_strerror.c, since
	it no longer contains translatable strings.
	* gnulib/*: Remove gnulib/ hierarchy.

	skip some of gnulib's new rules
	* cfg.mk (local-checks-to-skip): Add these: sc_error_message_uppercase,
	sc_program_name, sc_require_test_exit_idiom, sc_makefile_check.

	Prepare to use maint.mk from gnulib
	Since Makefile.maint will soon come from gnulib's maint.mk,
	sync Makefile.maint to have the same contents (modulo minor
	things).  In syncing it, we have to remove some libvirt-specific
	rules.  Since we want to keep them (of course), put those in cfg.mk.
	* Makefile.maint: Merge from gnulib's maint.mk.
	* cfg.mk (sc_avoid_write): New rule.  From Makefile.cfg.
	(sc_prohibit_strcmp_and_strncmp): Likewise, and rename.
	(sc_prohibit_asprintf, sc_prohibit_VIR_ERR_NO_MEMORY): Likewise.
	(sc_prohibit_nonreentrant): Likewise.
	(sc_prohibit_ctype_h): Likewise.
	(sc_TAB_in_indentation, sc_avoid_ctype_macros): Likewise.
	(sc_prohibit_virBufferAdd_with_string_literal): Likewise.
	(sc_prohibit_gethostby): Likewise.
	(sc_libvirt_unmarked_diagnostics): Likewise.  Also, rename the
	rule, inserting "_libvirt", since this rule is a specialization of
	the one in gnulib.
	* GNUmakefile: Include cfg.mk, not Makefile.cfg
	* .x-sc_prohibit_strcmp_and_strncmp: New file.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add .x-sc_prohibit_strcmp_and_strncmp

	* Makefile.cfg: Rename to...
	* cfg.mk: ...this.  New file.

2009-07-08  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	use automake-1.11's silent-rules option, when possible
	Don't use mylibtool, (subsumed by automake's silent rules)
	Its use was causing a non-srcdir build to fail.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove mylibtool.
	* configure.in: Don't use mylibtool.

	* configure.in: Use AM_SILENT_RULES([yes]),
	but only if that m4 macro is defined.
	Thus, it works even on systems that lack automake-1.11.
	Daniel Berrange suggested adding the conditional, so that
	we don't have a hard requirement on 1.11, e.g., for RHEL5.

2009-07-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	fix another failing "make distcheck" (qemuhelptest)
	It failed in a non-srcdir build because those 5 sample output
	files were not included in the distribution tarball.  Include them.
	* tests/Makefile.am (qemuhelpdata, EXTRA_DIST): Include these:
	kvm-74, kvm-86, qemu-0.10.5, qemu-0.9.1, qemu-kvm-0.10.5.

	fix failing "make distcheck"
	* docs/Makefile.am (xml): Distribute testpool.xml and testvol.xml,
	which are referenced from testnode.xml.

2009-07-08  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Make it easier to debug tests running programs
		* tests/testutils.c: Don't discard stderr when running

	Support <video> element for QEMU guests
		* src/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu_conf.h: Use -vga or -std-vga
		when starting guests if video card is present
		* tests/qemuhelptest.c: Change to use constants instead
		of hardcoded hex numbers, and add VGA support
		* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-graphics-sdl-fullscreen.xml,

		tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-input-xen.xml: Add <video>
		element for testing graphics adapter
		* tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c: Add QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_VGA flag
		* tests/qemuxml2xmltest.c: Add missing graphics-vnc-sasl/tls tests

	Support <video> tag for defining VGA card properties
	 * docs/schemas/domain.rng: Define <video> element schema
	 * src/domain_conf.c, src/domain_conf.h, src/libvirt_private.syms:
	   Add parsing and formatting for <video> element

2009-07-08  Daniel Veillard  <veillard@redhat.com>

	Report the object name on lookup error
	* src/network_driver.c src/node_device.c src/storage_driver.c:
	  many places in the code reported 'No xxx with matching name" after
	  a Lookup error without reporting the name used by the failed lookup

2009-07-08  Harshavardhana  <harsha@gluster.com>

	Add new net filesystem glusterfs
	* src/storage_conf.c src/storage_conf.h: adds glusterfs to the list
	  of network storage
	* libvirt.spec.in: adds the dependency on glusterfs-client

2009-07-07  Paolo Bonzini  <pbonzini@redhat.com>

	Avoid raising an internal error
	* src/qemu_conf.c: when connecting an interface if it reference
	  an undefined network, then we used to raise an internal error.

2009-07-07  Daniel Veillard  <veillard@redhat.com>

	Fix informations about previous git server
	* docs/downloads.html[.in]: update the secton about
