Desktop to Cloud (D2C) Getting Started Guide

To launch

Steps for creating and launching your first deployment with D2C.


1. Get access to an EC2-compatible cloud and insert 
	- For Amazon EC2: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/
	- For University of Tartu's SciCloud: https://scicloud1.mt.ut.ee:8443/#apply
	
	After signing up for either of the above clouds, you will be given access credentials.
	You will need the following credentials:
		User ID
		Key ID
		Secret Access Key
		EC2 Certificate
		EC2 Private Key
	
	Getting your credentials for SciCloud:
	
		Go to: https://scicloud1.mt.ut.ee:8443/#credentials
		Download credentials by clicking "Download Credentials"
		Unzip the directory and rename it to /home/<userid>/.euca
		
		From the file /home/<userid>/.euca/.eucarc you will find your credentials.
		In the D2C user interface, click on the keys "Account Settings" icon to enter the creds.
		Field mappings from the .eucarc file are:
			
			AWS User ID = EC2_USER_ID
			AWS Key ID = EC2_ACCESS_KEY
			AWS Secret Access Key = EC2_SECRET_KEY
			EC2 Certificate = EC2_CERT
			EC2 Private Key = EC2_PRIVATE_KEY
			
		Please not that values must be inserted fully expanded. 
		I.E., ${EUCA_KEY_DIR}/euca2-user-5a32032a-cert.pem should become:
		/home/user/euca2-user-5a32032a-cert.pem

2. Registering your VirtualBox image to D2C
	
	In the interface, navigate to the "Images" tab. Click the "Add Image" button.
	Enter a name for you image and the location of the .vdi file. 
	In the "Select associated cloud" dropdown, select "VirtualBox".
	
3. Creating a cloud image
	
	In the "Images" tab, click the name of your new image, then click the name of your VirtualBox VDI image.
	Next, click "Create AMI." Select the cloud you wish to migrate your VDI to. Next select a kernel and ramdisk.
	Next choose a bucket to store your image in. This can be any string name, such as "chris_1" or "experiment_images."
	Next click "Create AMI." Now, sit back and relax or play sudoku, as this may take a while. The total time depends on your 
	image size and connection speed to the cloud provider.
	
4. Create a Deployment Template.

	A deployment template specifies the roles of machines in your experiment, and their general scripting.
	
	Click the "Deployment Template Creation Wizard" icon (two connected computers). 
	Choose a name and click "Next."
	For each of the logical roles in your system,:
		Click "Add New Role."
		Select an image. Choose a name.
		The following fields are optional:
			Uploads
			Start Scripts
			File Done Check
			Data to Collect
		Click "Add New Role."
		
	When done adding roles, click "Finish."
	
5. Create a Cloud Specific Deployment

	After creating your template, you need to create a cloud specific deployment which will specify 
	the cloud to run on, the images to use, the type of machines to use and their number. This will define
	the concrete parameters for the execution of your experiment.
	
	Navigate to the "Deployments" tab. Select your deployment template. Next choose "Create Deployment."
	Select the cloud to run on. Choose the host count and instance (machine) type for each role.
	Click "OK" to create the deployment.
	
	You can review the deployment definition by navigating to it in the tree navigator. 
	It will be listed under the deployment template.
	To modify a role settings, right click the role name.
	
6. Launch the Deployment (Run Experiment)

	Navigate to your deployment and click "Deploy."
	D2C will now create the requested number of instances on the target cloud and execute your experiment
	scripts. When the experiment finishes (as determined by the finished check) D2C will download specified files 
	from the remote instances and the stop the deployment.
