Desktop To Cloud (D2C)

Required libraries:
wxPython

Required tools:
VirtualBox
Installation instructions for Ubuntu 10:

Note: instead of installing package viturtualbox-3.2, I installed virtualbox-ose.
The only required executable from this package is VirtualBoxManage.

After installing this in a development VirtualBox VM, I got errors during the boot process about 
being unable to mount the shared host folder due to an invalid vmboxsf.ko module. This was fixed by
running insmod on the module. See following for more details:
